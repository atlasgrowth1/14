Mary told me to check the digital display in the unit to see if it had an \"error code\", and it did. The code indicated that the generator would not start if emergency power was needed. Mary spoke with Kyle, the technician on-call, and told her it needed to be addressed. Kyle was great!. Arrived at the house about 5:45 and got the generator working. He said it likely needed a new regulator but that it should work fine until they replaced it.\nGreat service, great people, great price, and great work! I would recommend them to anyone."

They were prompt, respectful and completed the services in a timely manner.

We had a very bad experience with a install of a new unit with a small local HVAC company that needed repairs within one year. Brandon came out resolved the issues going over and beyond without bashing the other company after hearing our story.  We ended up needing another old unit replaced and went with Brandon after the great service on our first series of calls. Brandon had very competitive pricing and takes pride in his work. He is also very knowledgeable in diagnosing and trouble shooting issues. We have been taken to the cleaners with other HVAC companies and very thankful we found Brandon with Full Force. I know enough about HVAC systems to know when someone is giving us the run around as Brandon was very thorough in explaining our issues with different options and resolutions. I also ended up over paying Brandon and he caught it while doing our invoice. Brandon called explained what he found and personally delivered the difference of the overpayment. Brandon also has reached out to follow up on how the units are running after any work has been completed. I can\u2019t say enough of Brandon\u2019s workmanship, professionalism and ethics. We would highly recommend Brandon and Full Force to all of our family and friends."

All I needed was an outside spicket replaced. I was quoted more than double by two other plumbing companies that were trying to do more work than needed. He was able to do the job for less in less than 20 minutes (most of that time was me yapping anyways). He was kind, courteous, and the most helpful. I won't be going to any other plumbing company."

When he visited to give a quote for the A/C replacement, he thoroughly checked the existing system, measured the rooms for the size needed, wiped existing system clean and gave us good advise on maintaining vs replacing.\n\nAfter I did my research from 8 contractors, I found that Gipson's quote was midway from others. So when I mentioned that to him, he agreed on a quote that was amicable. He bought the system that I recommended Trane XR14, after my research and did a great job with the installation.\n\nIt was the best service ever with Shane sharing a ton of information about the system and it's maintenance. He was very courteous, caring and respectful and thanked us several times for the business. Overall, I'll definitely recommend him for everything technical to being amiable.\n\nSeveral years later, our relationship with this service provider continues to amaze us. We used them recently for moving the HVAC unit and the tankless water heater to a higher level to make way for home improvements. They did a fantastic job of not only planning and moving these without any inconveniences but also working with the home improvement contractor to strategize the move. Great job, Shane and the crew! Admire your workmanship and attention to detail."

The next day my wife began searching for contractors to come repair the system. We spoke to several highly rate businesses all of whom were either rude or couldn't get to us for days.\n\nEnter Gipson. The owner of the company answers my wife's call and uses his own name (Shane) not the company name, very personable. My wife describes our predicament, this conversation taking place around 10am, Shane says that while they are a small operation and have appointments booked all day, he would not end his day until we had ac back.\n\nShane was true to his word, by 5pm 2 technicians were at our house and working, while other companies gave us hassle about having to speak to our home warranty company, Gipson showed no hesitation to do what was necessary for us.\n\nFast efficient service and a very honest and detailed approach about the work that was being done. The repairs cost way less than we anticipated and they went the extra mile to install a simple cheap fix to avoid this issue in the future. We jumped at the opportunity to sign up for the yearly maintenance program which is exceedingly affordable. I decided even of we didn't need the service I was going to pay for it because this is the type of business that deserves to succeed!\n\nThank you Gipson, we are life long customers now!"

        "text": "First, let me mention that I have never written a review for any company or even a product I've purchased and loved from Amazon but Gipson Heating & Air Conditioning deserves a review.  I don't even know where to begin because they are so AMAZING.  The owner of this company literally has the key code to my front door because he is so trustworthy.  I wouldn't hesitate to let him babysit my children because he is such a great guy.  His staff as well.  My story is unique because what started with me calling him out to talk about a duct cleaning turned into my husband and I gutting our entire home for a remodel (for other reasons) and we wanted a brand new system.  Shane came out to do a load calculation to help us pick the perfect system.  He was so detailed that he climbed into the smallest, most cringy area underneath a stairway landing in my basement. I felt like I was watching the show Fear Factor because you couldn't have paid me to crawl under there!!  We sat down at the table and he explained with so much detail the system I needed.  What I found to be so funny, is that I have never met a HVAC guy that was so passionate about his work.  I thought I was going to have to kick him out because, at one point, I think he started doing algebra equations based on how many windows I have and insulation in the house and whether the sun rises or sets on backside of my roof...LOL.\n\nAnyways,  this remodel has taken two years and I don't know how many times he came out to my home to help me before I ever paid him a dime.  I have a longer chain of text messages to him than I do to some of my friends.  He has just been there to answer every...single...one of my questions. I have a beautiful new HVAC system now, all new ductwork, gas lines for my hot water heater and two fireplaces and an additional ductless, mini split system installed.  There is not a better, more skilled, or more honest HVAC company in this area....period!!"

He did a wonderful job fixing it after the company who installed it really messed it up. I thought we were having problems with the same system again because water randomly began leaking through our ceiling which is what had happened in the past, so my first thought was, \u201cUh-oh, the air conditioner is malfunctioning again.\u201d So I called Shane to check it out and it turned out to be our hot water heater. First of all, he answered my call on a weekend when he was doing other things on his own time and made our problem a priority to fix, which I truly appreciate. And instead of referring me out to someone else to deal with it since it wasn\u2019t an HVAC issue, he came out and replaced it himself and made modifications to ensure it could never leak through the ceiling again. Also, he discovered in the process that a faulty valve had malfunctioned on the outside of our house and was causing extraordinary water pressure on the inside, which had cost us thousands of dollars in repairs and appliance replacement, (including the water heater!), over the years! No one had ever been so thorough as to investigate something as simple but as impactful as the water pressure in our home, (and we had other big companies come out over the years). But Shane did and he even fixed that issue- spending literally hours digging out and replacing the broken valve in our front yard. We are so thankful that Shane was there to help us out. They really are jacks of all trades at Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning and are truly knowledgeable about many things across the board in terms of repairs. I have since referred others to Shane and Co with full confidence that he and his crew will always do the job right for a fair price, without taking advantage of people in the process, and will go above and beyond in the quality of their product and services.  And that, in and of itself, is worth more than anything to me. I do truly appreciate these fine people and cannot say enough good things about this company."

        "text": "I cannot say enough about Shane- owner of Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning. In order to give a better understanding of my situation let me say, without the intent of trashing anyone or their business, that when our system was replaced two years ago by the company that installed it, (who I also called for help yesterday when it stopped working), it malfunctioned quickly and flooded a bedroom ruining drywall and requiring extensive repairs. Eventually it had to be completely replaced as it never functioned properly. The replacement system needed a few tweaks, but eventually it seemed to work consistently and well and did for nearly a year- until yesterday. So, I contacted the company who installed the system and they were unable to come out immediately, nor could they give me a timeframe for their arrival.  It was 80 degrees inside, I have pets, and I needed someone there sooner rather than later. Shane wasted no time in getting to my house to assess the system and set to work immediately. In the process, he educated me on the system and gave me a complete rundown of what exactly was wrong, including a list of issues caused by the installers of the system, which were contributing to the malfunction of it. He also hauled off a large garbage bag of trash that the installers left in my attic! Additionally, his service charges were so reasonable I actually questioned him about it! His reply was basically that he would rather be good to customers, charge reasonably and fairly, and get great reviews and referrals than charge exorbitant amounts of money for his services! I was blown away! Now my air is working beautifully, I didn\u2019t spend a fortune to get it fixed, and he has a customer for LIFE. Try Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning. Their work ethic, professionalism, quality work product, and positive results speak for themselves!"

They replaced all the duct work in my crawlspace and planned the work in such a way that I did not have to go a single sleepless night without my AC running. Thorough, fast, efficient, professionals at a fair price. They provided additional solutions for my indoor air-return grid and oddly designed bathroom wall vent cover, and even solved a vexing gas valve problem with my antique 1957 Caloric Ultramatic wall oven. Best experience I've ever had with contractors of any kind.  Happy to HIGHLY RECOMMEND Shane Gipson and his crew. I should also point out that my HVAC unit is cooling the house better than ever with sparkling clean air, now that my new duct work matches the output capacity of my unit."

        "text": "The quality, value, professionalism, responsiveness and dependability options in this survey all apply to Gipson Heating and Air but honesty is what I like most about this company. They have Serviced my 15 year old home unit for two years now and have never tried to sell me a new unit. Shane (the owner) always says he can keep it running with routine service and by topping off the freon at the beginning of each summer. He recommends this as it is cheaper for me and the best option with kids in college and a new unit is not needed right now. Previous HVAC companies pitched the need for a new unit based on age before even inspecting it.\n\nBut when it comes time for a new unit, as it was when Gipson replaced the 30+ year old unit in our rental house this summer, it was another positive experience with this company. Shane checked the unit, explained why this unit could not be repaired (it had rusted through in many areas) and recommended the best and most affordable unit for replacement. He even set me up with financing which allowed for payoff in six months with no interest.\n\nIt\u2019s a very vulnerable feeling when you have problems that you don\u2019t fully understand and feel like you are at the mercy of the repair tech\u2019s information. I don\u2019t have this feeling with Gipson as they take the time to explain and actually show you what the problem is before making the repair (Shane sent pictures to me at work when a fan motor needed replacing during last summer\u2019s service).\n\nI cannot recommend this company enough strictly based on their honesty and work ethics."

They were on another job but managed to find our part, pick it up and come fix our issue around 5:00 today. The same day!!!! I can\u2019t thank them enough.

Knowing we had two 20 year old HVAC systems, we were faced with replacing both systems. As a result, we did our due diligence to obtain quotes, which sadly took over a month to get three that were actually apples-to-apples .\n\nWe were nearly ready to pull the trigger when we came across Gipson. Not only did we get a quote FAST, but their quote was incredibly detailed; including sketches of our ductwork. In retrospect, this wasn't a big surprise, since Gipson actually did a full, comprehensive review, well beyond the cursory inspections the others did. Gipson asked questions the others didn't, revealed critical items the others missed, and provided additional details that truly benefited us. Their best suggestion was flipping a horizontal system to vertical. Yhis change gave us a tremendous amount of additional attic space, a genuine bonus!\n\nWe could go on singing Gipson's praises but will wrap up by simply saying all work was performed exactly as quoted, the installation was top notch, was done as promised and on time. If you need HVAC work done, one call is all you will need - and that's to Gipson."

These guys not only KNOW THEIR STUFF, they explain the findings/process in a way that those of us who are less HVAC inclined can actually understand. Even more...they\u2019re affordable! They did an inspection on a home my husband and I are in the process of purchasing. They were there at the exact time they said they would be. They were very efficient. They took pictures of everything and explained to us their findings while showing us the photos! They also sent those photos to us with the inspection report so that there would be no doubts when we sent that same report to the sellers to request repairs. These guys have great communication and they just seem like genuinely good people! A day or so after, when we had received our report and they had been paid (and we didn\u2019t expect to hear from them again until we had more hvac needs) I received a message from them just informing us that the seller had contacted them to price repairs. This was not something they had to do, but they did it anyway. Like I said, they\u2019re just genuinely  good guys! I\u2019ve boasted about them to anyone who will listen. They truly went above and beyond what we expected. I read reviews before purchasing ANYTHING so I know how important these reviews are to future customers! Listen...book these guys!

I\u2019ve been a homeowner for 26 years and am on my second Trane heat pump system.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that Gipson Heating & Air Conditioning gave me the most thorough service I\u2019ve received in those 26 years. They not only performed the seasonal maintenance on my unit, but discovered and remedied additional problems. They even corrected mistakes made by previous contractors which could have led to a malfunction of my unit in the future.\n(One example: I had been dealing with a condensation problem in my air handler and Shane Gipson explained why it was happening and fixed it immediately. By the way, the condensation was caused by the omission of an important step which another company\u2019s rep had not bothered to return my call on, much less offer to remedy.)\nShane Gipson\u2019s knowledge and expertise was surpassed only by his willingness to go above and beyond what he initially came to do. And he patiently answered all my questions (I had many).\nI urge you to give Gipson Heating & Air a call when you next need maintenance work or repair on your heating/air unit, no matter the brand. You will not be disappointed. In fact, you may be amazed that there are still those who have such a work ethic and hold themselves to such a high standard. And you will be left with peace of mind, knowing that no stone was left unturned in the care of your system. I thank Shane and Shawn for their impeccable service."

Most recently, they did a complete furnace replacement and even helped with the financing through our local utility company. They gave me three options of furnaces with upfront pricing and held true to their quote. They worked for 2 and a half days in the rain to make sure that we would have heat ahead of the cold front. Again, they took photos of their work along the way and went above and beyond what was required of them for the install. I cannot express how satisfied we have been working with Shane and his team at Gipson Heating and Air.

He said he could look at our air conditioner when he finished theirs. We didn't have to make an appointment when we needed help immediately, he was willing to come to our aid! The next day he returned because we had another issue. This man was a GOD send! Very professional and courteous, and he answered all our questions. We had our air back the first night, the second night we had very, very cold air! If I ever need help again I am going to use them!"

She received a few quotes from companies and although Gibson was not the lowest they were the most professional and were willing and able to do the entire job and not leave a whole in the wall to be fixed by another contractor she would have to pay.\nI agreed to stay at her home so she would not need to take a day off work and we wanted someone at the house incase there was a problem or questions that they needed to check with us before doing.\nThe owner showed up a few minutes before the agreed on time which was before his normal business hours because my sister asked if he could start early so I would not have to say there all day.  By 9 am he had already removed the old unit and started getting the new unit ready to install.  When his employees arrived they immediately came up to me and introduced themselves.  The two employees were clean and neatly dressed.\nWhile working they took the time to clean as they went never leaving a mess or tools laying around.  I watched the entire crew (owner included) and they all worked very well together and each of them seemed to care about the job as the owner.  All would answer any questions I had and were more polite than I can ever get my children to be.  I requested some very minor changes to the was a drain line ran and they immediately agreed and said it would not charge the price.\nWhen they were done all their work looked so neat, clean, and organized.  They went back with my sister and me both explaining everything they did and why they did it.  They went over what she had asked them to do and made sure she was happy with everything.  While working he also found a few other things that were not up to code that he fixed to bring everything around the unit up to the latest codes.  While the owner was doing all this his employees were cleaning everything they were even near.  They vacuumed a carpet that had probably not been vacuumed in a long while and swept out the entire garage.\nWhen it came time to pay he said he already told her the price.  My sister asked about any extra costs and the owner explained that he does not believe in changing the price after agreeing to the job and any extra cost that occurs he absorbs.\nIn my opinion these were some of the very best contractors I have ever been around working in my home or someone else's.  All the employees seemed to enjoy their job and the company they worked for.  Great job all of you."

Unlike most other companies, Mr. Gipson was willing to accommodate my work schedule and came at 7am so I would not have to leave work.\n\nHe was on time and nothing but professional from the start. He quickly identified the issue with the AC unit (the same one that was supposed to require a new unit) and got the AC up and running within 20 minutes. To top it off the price charged for the work done was more than reasonable.\n\nAfter completing the job Mr. Gipson stayed and thoroughly cleaned the unit and sent me before and after pictures showing the work performed. The customer service and professional care shown was above and beyond all expectations.\n\nI cannot say enough about the honesty, professionalism, and quality of this company. Will have my business so long as I am in the area."

The technician had the part on his truck & made the repair immediately, after giving us the pricing upfront.\n\nI worked on the administrative side of the hvac business for almost 10 years, so my expectations for service were high. Campbell's checked all the boxes. Our issue was resolved within 2 hours from making the initial call. We will have them back to do our bi-annual maintenance from now on. Highly recommend!"

        "text": "My experience with Myers Comfort Specialist of Birmingham has been frustrating, disappointing, and still ongoing. When my gas heat went out last Tuesday Feb 11th, I called American Home Shield which is my home warranty. They sent Myers my contact info with Phone and email. They called my phone number and spoke with me directly to come out to diagnose the issue on February 12th.\n\nThey came and had to order a new board that would arrive at the beginning of week. When the board arrived on Tuesday, Instead of updating me directly with the same contact info they initially called and contacted me with, they called my deceased husband\u2019s phone and left him a message causing unnecessary delays bc I had no idea they had called. He has been deceased for over a year.\n\nI called Myers this morning over a week later from the initial call to ask if the part came in bc it was below freezing at 22 last night. That is when they tell me they have called my deceased husbands contact info on Tuesday to let him know the part arrived. I\u2019m unsure how they got my deceased husbands info, but that isn\u2019t the info we had been using to communicate with about ordering the new part for this service. We froze last night and now we got another night to go before they come for service. They put it off another day.\n\nDespite extreme freezing temperatures today and tonight they have failed to prioritize my situation, and my son and I have been left without heat for another night again. It will be 17 degrees for the low tonight. I can\u2019t believe them knowing this and having the part on hand, will not send anyone out bc everyone has left for the day by 9am in the morning per the manager and assistant.\n\nTheir poor communication and lack of urgency have made this an incredibly stressful experience, and I would not recommend their service to anyone."

The first time he came he thought he had it fixed and running, which it was.  Not much longer I realized it was still not working.  I called Myers Comfort customer service department to let them know.  Jamie came back and after an hour of working on the heat we woke up to a warm house this morning!  That was really nice due to the cold snap we are having starting last night.  Thank you Jamie and everyone in the customer service department for your amazing service and technical knowledge.  I fully recommend Myers Comfort Specialists for your HVAC needs!"

Not only did he fix the issue, but he also took the time to explain what went wrong and how the new part would ensure reliable heating. Louis was professional, knowledgeable, and incredibly friendly throughout the entire process. Thanks to him, our home will be warm and comfortable again.

        "text": "Do not use, especially when you make a claim with American home shield or any home warranty company. They came out to mine and said the coil leak was pre existing to my contract. Which there is no way to know that. They got me denied and tried to get me to buy new units from them that were well over 10k. A shady company like that needs to be reported and taken down.\n\nUpdate: They replied back saying they tried to get carrier to honor a warranty but said it was in georgia. First, I\u2019m in Alabama. Second, the company I\u2019m using said they called carrier and it\u2019s not under warranty because I was not the original person who made the warranty. The warranty was null and void in 2021. Long before I bought the current house.  this is another lie. Lastly, the company I used installed a new air handler and charged me 4K for the whole thing (labor and Freon included) where Myers tried to get me to buy a coil for 4500 all the way to the air handler which was 7k. If you look down the comments there are at least 10 where they had issues with Myers and the home warranty company. Either they worded it to where the warrant company did not honor it. Or they put wrong parts and messed it up so later on, they would reap the benefit."

        "text": "Do not use this company. I have had unbelievable experiences with them. One year at my personal home they sent their manager out to my home to fix a blown April brand thermos tat (it was installed by Myers) that completely went blank which caused me not to have air. So I called the office they sent their manager out and he was mad because I gave them a one star with my home warranty company. He totally disrespected me in my own home about the review. I videotaped the whole thing. I had been living in my home since 2016 and never had been talked to and disrespected in my own house by anyone. Also, he was trying to charge me over 200.00 for a Sensi thermometer that was online for 169.00. Also, allegedly I never received credit for April thermostat that was purchased from them. So basically I was out of 290.00 in thermostat costs. Now just recently they came to another property of mine and sent a report to my warranty company saying that I had a dirty coil. My insurance contract covers any breakdowns due to rust, no maintenance and sediment which is dirt. Instead of them sending in what part had stop working. He decided to send in his personal opinion as if he is the master of ac Darryl I think his name was. So my insurance company denied the claim because he put secondary damage as if something besides the dirty coil damaged the system. So basically in my opinion they just go around collecting the 125.00 we have to pay the warranty company and they don\u2019t do no work. Notice they don\u2019t come prepared to work it\u2019s always a follow up appointment."

They sent a technician to my home, but he did not make any repairs. The technician mentioned that he had only received two and a half months of training and needed to write a report to his company before a follow-up crew could take over.\nTo make matters worse, two days after the technician left, I received a notice from my home warranty company stating that the service was completed. This is unacceptable. My AC is still not fixed, and I am left without any resolution, especially during this high temperature summer. I am very angry and disappointed with the service provided by Myers Comfort Specialists. I would not recommend their services to anyone."

Heather was very kind and helpful with organizing the HVAC replacement. Dan and his Son did an amazing job installing the new unit. We have had no issues for 2 years. We have utilized their maintenance twice a year (spring / fall). Their team are rockstars. The icing on the cake took place last night (Saturday night). We had a lightning storm come through and damaged our system. I texted Heather and she called me back promptly. Although it was afterhours, Dan came right out , within an hour,  and fixed the system quickly. Luckily it was just a capacitor but their friendly, caring, and knowledgeable service significantly impacts my confidence and comfort as their customer. Service like this creates customers for life! I highly recommend them and encourage you to do business with this family owned company!"

After discovering them they will be the only ones that I will ever touch my A/C unit. Dan and his family are very professional and respectful to the customer. They will do what whatever it takes and will go above and beyond to help solve the problem. Thats what I like about them.\n\nBack in 2020 I had a leak in my evaporator coil (at the time it was a 13 year old unit, yes a little old) the first two companies I had come out and instantly said I need a new unit. Dan and his Son came out replace the evaporator coil and had the unit up and running like as if it was new. They didn't try to force / sell me on a new unit, they saw the problem and fixed it without hesitation. If they tell you that you need a new unit it is most likely that you really do and the old unit is beyond repair or would cost just as much to fix.\n\nIf you need any A/C work done this is the family you want to go with. Professional, respectful, honest and down to earth you will not be disappointed."

Martin Service arrived with parts in hand within an hour of us calling them on a Saturday afternoon.  They had us back up and running within hours and charged us thousands less than the other company had quoted and they were able to do the work immediately.  They were super professional, gave us a great price and had everthing installed and cleaned up within just a few hours. The even went the extra mile by following up the next day to make sure we were happy with the repairs.  I highly recommend you use them.

They showed up on time, even called before hand to verify address and that someone would be home. After servicing my 17 year old R-22 unit, checking on prices to repair or replace, we discuss the options and for me that was replacing the unit. We discuss the different unit options and their benefits. Help with financing if I wish. With this information I was able to make an informed decision and schedule my install. Air logistics personnel were courteous and professional throughout. After finishing the install, in the rain I will add, they made sure everything was clean and all trash was removed. Highly impressed and definitely recommend them for your HVAC needs."

First warranty company contractor was at our house for 20 minutes and said everything was fine. They took our deductible and refused to return our calls. We knew there was a problem and disputed the eval. 911 Air immediately identified multiple holes in our coil and offered us a great price on a new system.  Without hesitation, they did extra work for no cost that wasn't included in the initial quote. Really great company. Very impressed with the honesty, professionalism, and customer service. Ricky installed and services our system and can't say enough good things."

The prices he charges are very reasonable and the service is top notch.  He just replaced my 4 ton AC system at my home, but that was my choice.  I chose the new system over a repair that I could have made to my 11 year old system.  It is very nice to have an HVAC company (and a contractor in general) that I can trust."

I chose 911 Air because of the great reviews, and it was the right choice! Danny returned my call promptly, came on time, and was able to fix the issue easily (simple broken wire). He was up front and let me know that my unit was very old, just so I could be aware of issues in the future. I'm so glad he did, and any ol' technician could have just as easily told me the unit needed to be replaced right then, since it was so old. Thank you Danny for quality, trustworthy work!"

He took pictures of everything so that we could see exactly what he saw and worked on. He did let us know we would likely have to replace our unit in the next couple of years, but for now it should be fine. He didn\u2019t try to push any unnecessary parts, or services on us, and the cost of services we did receive was more than reasonable. We will be using them for all of our hvac needs moving forward!"

We thought everything was great because he seemed really nice and knowledgeable well we were wrong. After a few years we noticed that there was a strange smell that we couldn\u2019t figure out where it was coming from in the kitchen and front bathroom. There was small flies coming out of the drain in the front shower bathroom. Rick would not return our calls so we called another company. Come to find out he did the plumbing all wrong and not to code. He used the wrong size pipes under the garbage disposal and all the food and water was going under the house into the crawl space. 3000 dollars later we got the work corrected.\nYou might be questioning why I am posting this now.\nWe just ran into someone who recently had a horrible experience with Rick and I thought I would share my experience so others would not fall into the same trap."

I have been waiting for 3 weeks  now for the repair.\n\nI was told on Oct 27th that they located and ordered a heat exchanger and would be back on Nov 10th to repair it.  I questioned the long wait time then and I was told it was due to shipping and could do nothing about it.\n\nOn Nov 10th, no one showed up.  I called on the 11th and was told I would have to wait until they could put me back on the schedule and it would be Monday, Nov 13th for the repair.  Once again, no one showed up. Called again and was told they are now coming on the 14th, no one again, and happened again on the 15th.\n\nEvery time I call ANY number I can find for Sears Repair its either disconnected and automated recording with no option to speak to a living breathing person!  ANY number I am given by the call center regarding my warranty repair, gives the SAME automated message with no option speak to a live person that can directly and personally respond to this outstanding repair.\n\nIt is absolutely absurd that there are no working numbers for the local repair businesses Sears has doing their repair work.  More absurd that no option to get connected or dispatched to local business is an option.  The call center can talk to the local busiess but the person who pays for the home warranty cannont.\n\nThe ONLY positive thing I can say is the repair man who came out to diagnose the problem, was very professional and helpful.\n\nToday is Nov 16th and I am still waiting for a confirmed time for repair.  Meanwhile the temp is in the 20's and 30's."

However, they managed to destroy one of the light fixtures that was on the front of the house -  I had to purchase new light fixtures.  In addition, the crew put siding over the wires for the light fixture at the back of the house - so, the foreman couldn't figure out where the fixture was supposed to be hung.  (Supposedly, one of the members of his crew remembers where the fixture is supposed to go).  Now, over 3 weeks after they finished placing the siding, I still wait for them to return and put up my new light fixtures at the front of the house - and the old one at the back of the house where the wires are covered."

The crew showed up unannounced. They installed the wrong products on the roof. They left a mess when we were promised that there would be clean up everyday. We were told they at would have but the project coordinator didn\u2019t schedule a dumpster. The project coordinator also did not clearly tell the crew what products were to be installed where nor did he tell them where to drop off the products. Not exactly sure what what the project coordinator did. I do have to admit that I\u2019m am analyzing his job more critically as I am the project coordinator at a law firm. Our siding was damaged as well as our ceiling in our kitchen.\n\nThe siding was repaired as requested, the house was cleaned as requested, and the flat roofing did get installed where it should have been.\n\nWe are still waiting for the reimbursement for the kitchen celing repair even though we submitted an estimate for the repair from a contractor.\n\nWe now have three leaks in our celing. I am extremely dissatisfied at this point in time. Sears was the more expensive option and we went with it because of the promise of excellent service that came with the sears name.\n\nWith these leaks we have more celing damage and now possible window damage."

The installers got the carpet in OK; however, the installation agency Home Depot hired failed to tell the nice installers they needed to have the nail gun on hand to install the Shoe Molding. My husband and son were very nice to handle the Shoe Molding removal for them. Our initial agreement when the porch was measured was to handle ALL of the Shoe Molding necessaries. I do not blame the installers and they did a nice job with what they could accomplish. I  believe our experience with Home Depot was due to the fact that they use an installation contractor, so they cannot stand behind the installation. Lowe's is our favorite now!"

Today, I called our home warranty company as we had a problem that another company tried to fix 35 days ago. Our unit would shut off which made the home very cold (or hot) depending on the season, and sometimes unlivable. Bo Jiffy came out within 4 hours to fix our problem and ensure we didn\u2019t freeze as the temperature plummets into the mid to low 30s tonight. They were beyond accommodating and understanding. I will be requesting Bo Jiffy any time I call my home warranty company for HVAC repairs in the future. Do yourself a favor and seek these guys out. You cannot go wrong."

This is the third company who had worked on it in less than a year, all assigned through FA. After going without ac for three months with two adults, three kids, and two dogs in our home we pushed for them to assign a different contractor. On a Thursday, after fighting with FA and the other contractor (Elite Air) over missing/wrong parts, FA finally assigned our claim to Bo Jiffy. He came out the next morning and we had ac within a few hours. He showed me exactly what was wrong, recharged the unit, and we have been good to go since! Highly, highly recommended!"

They sent me at least six different technicians over the course of two months, but none of them were able to fix my HVAC unit. Bo came and took his time to diagnose and fix the problem in just two days. He was very pleasant to talk to, and I would definitely call him first if I ever have another HVAC issue."

        "text": "I wish I could give them ten stars because they deserve every one.  Bo Jiffy is our heat and cooling company from now on warranty or no. 4 different companies  were sent out. The first tech couldn't figure it out, the second tech rigged it up to run on heat strips which meant the air would never work, the third guy said that we needed a new system that of course the warranty company would not cover. Robert from Bo Jiffy was the charm. He was thorough and checked the system back and forth multiple times. Even once he had everything up and running he ran the air tested it then the heat and tested it then the air again and then the heat again. So far so good.  He was quick professional and best of all he actually fixed the issue. Robert kept us informed about his location so we were not waiting all day wondering when he would show up. I can't sing their praises enough. This is one very satisfied customer.\n\nI am so impressed. I was super leery  of dealing with another technician because the people that our warranty company has been sending out have been quite awful. He restored my  faith in the warranty company and repair people all of them aren't awful money grubbing liars even though most of them seem to be. Rest assured they will be thorough and take care of you. If you have choice warranty I suggest you cut out the headache and specifically ask for this company. They are worth the wait if there is one. Our work order was put in on Saturday they were out here  on Monday.\n\nI love to have reasons to compliment a company and they gave me plenty."

They were sent out through our home warranty 4 different times due to our unit never being fixed, it would work for a day or two then stop again and be 88-94 degrees in our home. Now, we have water damage as well and he poured the WRONG FREON and also overloaded it. We are now having to buy an entire new system out of pocket due to our home warranty sending companies like this out and fix water damage out of our pocket! Also, they are completely unprofessional. For example, the owner of this branch was the technician as well that came out and he proceeded to take his shirt off and \u201cwork\u201d while there was only a young woman in the house!! He was not the fittest either, very disturbing. Also, he new we have a small child too and he wouldn\u2019t come out until it was convenient for him and complained about it every time we had to call to set up an appointment AGAIN because he lived 45 minutes away. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! (I don\u2019t want to give them a star but it wouldn\u2019t let me post this unless I did.)"

The crew came out on a Sunday and tried to repair my pump, but that didn\u2019t work, so they got a new, better, much quieter pump with all the fittings and had it installed by Monday afternoon. Works perfectly, they cleaned up after themselves, I won\u2019t hesitate to call them again."

Never in my life has a tech come out and was able to figure out what was going on so quickly and take care of business while throughly explaining what happened.\n\nVery professional, emails the next day with invoice and a typed break down of all procedures and recommendations.\n\nHamza is a professional and I am glad I found someone honest and reliable to work with in the future. I recommend him and his company for any HVAC needs. He came out in the middle of a flood/tornado because he told me he would come that day and he did!\n\nThis is very hard to find. Prices are comparable but very reasonable. They don\u2019t push a bunch of products on you. My air conditioner was up and running within 30 minutes & there haven\u2019t been any problems since. It is a 20 year old unit but wasn\u2019t forced to pay for a replacement, a new thermostat or pay for a lengthy inspection.\n\nThat\u2019s because Hamza isn\u2019t gonna rip you off.

He was professional and friendly and he was knowledgeable.\n\n2024 UPDATE: The review above is older.  Today is 8/14/2024. It has taken me months to update this review of a company I think so highly of but we are in a marketplace and as a consumer, I would want to know. Previously (appx 4-5yrs ago) Wright replaced a blower motor in my ac unit. The cost: just under 800.00. In late May / early June 2024, the same company replaced the same part (Different technician). The cost: 1645.00. It was hot, Im menopausal, I panicked and let them do the repair; YES I should have checked with another company. Today's review is to inform, not to slander. I had the thermostat replaced by another company. That company told me that their cost to replace the motor would have  been close to the 800.00 rate I'd paid previously. Wright's technicians have always been professional and friendly. However, I dont know if that 1645.00 was an honest rate for the job. Just a quick FYI and dont panic like I did. Reduced my rating from 5 stars to 3 because they more than doubled the rate for the same job."

Additionally, they levy charges for every subsequent issue that arises, seeking to extract an additional $99 from customers. I strongly advise seeking a reputable personal HVAC professional to avoid falling victim to their deceptive tactics and potential exploitation."

Throughout the day three different technicians descended on our property getting the old one hauled away, a new one relocated and installed and even helped clear out unnecessary ductwork. Respectful and professional, they didn't stop until the work was completed even though into dinner hours. They kinda left a mess but we were there to clean it up. They did no damage. We had hot water and no leaka in less than 2r hrs. Please support this company as opposed to the larger top-heavy ones. These guys do great work and are committed to customer satisfaction."

Jay, with his helper, replaced 2 old leaky outside sptickets. Less than 24 hour request for assistance and Western Sales fixed my plumbing issues. Thank you so much for being a wonderful business and providing quality service. They have been my go to plumbing, heating and a/c vendor for almost 20 years. 5 stars !!!\n\nWestern Sales' Frank was able to diagnose and repair my brother Frank's (yes, two Franks) central air conditioning. Western gave many options / times for the repair. Frank from Western pulled into the driveway and went right to work. Frank from Western was also super great in coordinating with roofers, today. New roof today, too. As I was only available this Friday. I thank you Western for being dependable, accountable, knowledgeable and friendly. Thank you for sending Frank to help my brother, Frank !!!"

My emailed statement stated that the unit needed servicing but I was not asked about it being performed or about having it scheduled.\n\nI asked why it cost so much to run the cable and was informed they would ask about it but was never contacted. They just sent me another bill. When I got a bill I called to ask again to verify the cost. Was not contacted and called to pay on June 22nd so the transaction would be finished. I was unable to get an answer for why they never contacted me back.\n\nThey are knowledgeable and will fix your AC the first time. This is offset by being expensive and poor communication."

They came out and fixed what was needed and we had a good experience. We flip and rent houses and have had multiple units replaced through Old Republic through Affordable Heating and Air. They told us to contact their nephew Nate (their technician) for our needs and we have for years. In Dec 2023, Nate quoted us a unit and we sent him money for it. Weeks went by without installation and then he said he needed more money for an upgrade of which we sent. $5,200 WAS STOLEN FROM US. When I say stole, he literally texted us and told us he USED OUR MONEY FOR CHILD SUPPORT AND WILL PAY US BACK. I have the texts. It\u2019s insane. But what is more insane is that his family and owners would let a long time customer be robbed and not make us whole. It tells you everything you need to know about how they run a business.\n\nWe contacted his aunt who is the owner of the company and even after hearing everything, she offered for us to pay $4k MORE at supposed cost to \u201cmake it right\u201d. We originally said no that we wanted our unit for the price agreed upon and we wouldn\u2019t be outlaying any more money until it was installed. Two days later once we realized we just needed to get it done, we call back and say fine, we will pay the money and just lose out on the rest since you won\u2019t take responsibility for your employee/nephew that STOLE FROM US. At that point she then said that they no longer were offering a discount and basically told us to fly a kite. If you do use them, do not outlay any money until the unit is installed. I hope Old Republic will end their contract with them so nobody else is a victim like we were.\n\nI took this review down originally because after posting it, the owner Russell called me to tell me that he really would fix it and he was sorry that there was a miscommunication. We talked for 30 minutes and I agreed to take it down. After a week and a half has gone by and he refuses to answer or return my call, I have no choice but to put it back up. I am the only victim here and have still not received my $5,200 back that was stolen from me. These people are thieves and liars. I cannot believe they think it is okay to conduct their business this way. My sister also paid them $2,000 for work that we can also not get a call back on. Do not associate with this company. The Alabaster inspector says he will be reporting them to the state board."

My appointment was scheduled for Friday and the technician called and stated it was raining ( not sure what rain has to do with an inside unit) and needed to reschedule that next morning between 9-10. Technician Nathaniel Brooks was a complete no show. After rearranging my entire day and LEAVING A VOICE-MAIL this guy never calls back to say anything. I call Monday morning and the supervisor, by the way was very helpful, stated Mr. Brooks FORGOT TO PUT ME ON THE SCHEDULE....HOW!? Even With that being the case I left a voice message on his phone THAT MORNING! So you don't check your phone all day..OK\nMore frustration added to a more frustrating situation. Highly Disappointed"

        "text": "Affordable Heating and Air was sent to my house as part of American Home Shield Home Warranty program. The technician NEVER put a gauge on the condensing unit to check refrigerant levels. Instead he told me Ahs required him to put Freon in the unit; although, it leaks the refrigerant out, and he said it would cost $1432.00 out of my pocket. He told me what a horrible company Ahs is, and while I agree, he attempted to price gouge me at a $199.00 per pound, I\u2019ve been paying $50.00 per pound. He never asked if I wanted him to, but rather stated, \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to do this and I don\u2019t blame you, if it was mine, I wouldn\u2019t do it either. I\u2019ll send in the report telling them what I found.\u201d He sent in the report and stated customer refused to allow him to add refrigerant. He did not have to add 8 lbs of refrigerant to test the system, but this was his way of making a quick buck thinking unsuspecting customers will not know. I would highly recommend you FIND\nANOTHER COMPANY to do your hvac work. The audacity of attempting to charge $200 per lb is ignorant at best and is the definition of a scam artist at worst. The lies to me and deceptive trade practices by never putting a gauge on the equipment, and stating I refused is repugnant. DO NOT USE these folks, and never buy a home warranty from American Home Shield, I\u2019m wondering now if they are colluding to unsuspecting customers?"

They order a part for heating and picked the part up last Wednesday. The people said they would be giving me a call to put the part in, the part is the condenser part on the heater., they picked the part up last Wednesday. The people said they would be giving me a call to put the part in, so I waited to receive a call back.  I didn't receive a call back.  Home Warranty said that Affordable Care Heating and Air would be giving me a call back.  They first came to put the blower in the heating unit upstairs at the beginning of November. Instead of fixing the downstairs heating, they closed the case.  So I am left sitting in the freezing cold. I called the company, they were supposed to fix the claim. They had to order the parts. The part came Wednesday before Thanksgiving. They said they would put the part on Monday and give me a call. I received no call, no txt, no nothing. I call back to the company to see when they were putting the part in. Owner of Affordable Care company called said they withdraw claim because I have been harassing them. Now I have to start the procedure all over because the women lied on me. I never harassed anyone. I only called the company one time to see when they would be fixing my heating unit.  Not only that, but I am still cold and don't have any heat. Furthermore, I feel like I have been lied on by the company. I do not recommend anyone do business with this company. If she lies on me, who else will she lie on. I'm freezing with no heat because of a lie she told just to get out of fixing my heating unit."

He was advised he will get a 30 minute courtesy call which never happened. About 4pm he continued to call and AHS continued to call and didn't get an answer. About 8pm I got a text after I left a voicemail, letting them know how unprofessional they are. You think they would know that the courteous thing to do is to call a let your customers know your not coming or running late. They text and asked could they schedule us for first thing Saturday morning which we agreed. First thing Saturday morning turned into 1pm Saturday afternoon. I would NOT recommend them to anyone, the customer service and overall service is very poor and so unprofessional. The technician didn't have a clue what he was doing, they are ripping people off and just getting money to get contract work. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME\u203c\ufe0f"

I refused to let him do that. The second person to come out was their so called leak specialist. He just as quickly diagnosed that the evaporator coil was leaking. He determined this without looking in the air handler. What a joke. Prior to the second person coming out, I paid a local HVAC company to come out and their Technician did a thorough inspection and located the leak in the accumulator as evidenced by oil residue and Freon leak detector. I would not use Affordable at any price nor a home warranty company that contracts with them. Affordable\u2019s office person, Tanya, was very friendly and professional."

Instead of telling me the hot water heater was out and we needed a new one, they told me that the pilot light was out from last night's storm. I would have never known the difference. Charlie mentioned that could be the case and Tod came out and confirmed, while I was thinking we would have to buy a new one. Tod came with someone he was training and they were both so professional, polite, and honest!! We had them toilets and a few other things. Fair pricing and the best service!! Highly recommend Sentry for all of your HVAC, plumbing and electrical needs!"

        "text": "If you can avoid using this company to service your generators, I highly recommend that. We had a contract with them to come and service our generator. For the same appointment that they made us reschedule at least 2 times for issues on their end, they ghosted us each of those times. Today was the third. We called this morning to ensure they were going to be able to make their appointment and they ensured they would. My mother waited most of the day and finally had to use the restroom. Of course they called while she did that and they didn\u2019t leave a message. She immediately called them back and they put the manager on the phone, and the manager coldly said sorry, you weren\u2019t there and didn\u2019t care at all about the fact no message was left and they had already sent the contractor off to another job. Talk about crap customer service and this female manager they have should not be working this job. I wasn\u2019t there when she picked this job but if I had, I would\u2019ve told her it\u2019s not a good fit for her. My mother finally said, \u201clook, if you don\u2019t want to service our generator, please just tell us so we can cancel our contract and go find someone else to do it.\u201d So at the end of the day, they don\u2019t honor their contracts and there\u2019s no point in talking to them about it because they\u2019ll just tell you you\u2019re SOL."

Tech installed oil then had trouble accepting that I did not want a service contract. #3. Tech said bad generator battery so I got voltmeter and showed him to be wrong (the battery clearly had a date sticker from three months prior.). So tech decided generator needed new battery cable clamps and he installed them and said all was well and I paid him.  #4.  Two months later a power outage and generator did not come in.  I inspected and see that the new battery clamps are loose on the terminals.  Called Sentry who said it was out of warranty and there would be a service charge.  I protested and asked to speak to an owner but instead was put on hold then was told they  would send someone but if the problem was not the new clamps I would be charged.  I agreed and then no one ever came.    Today I replaced the clamps as Sentry had installed ones that were too big.   So to summarize:  their technicians are incompetent. Their customer service is terrible. And they don\u2019t stand behind their work."

They assessed the situation that day and offered to fix it immediately but there would be extra charges since they would have to get parts from vendors who were closed.  This would entail calling them in and there was no idea when thry might get things going.  We were able to get by with space heaters until Monday when they arrived early, stayed late and got a new system in.  We;ve had them check and clean it twice a year since then and it runs like a top."

Since Sentry had installed our second level HVAC several years ago, I knew I could call them and get excellent service. They came the next day and started work the following day. Kenneth Wells explained that I could add an air purifier that would help my mom\u2019s breathing on a daily basis. Great News!! Thanks Kenneth. The two technicians, Jamie and Jordan H.,Were both very friendly and professional. They worked really hard to get the job done before the end of day. They were life savers!! I will definitely recommend Sentry services to others, as well as continue to use myself!"

We were very satisfied with the entire process from electrical upgrades required by the city to final installation.\n- We are remodeling our kitchen and needed to relocate an air conditioning vent.  Wesley provided an estimate and the work was completed timely and efficiently.  Diego and Caleb performed the electrical work we needed; new circuits for the dishwasher and oven.  This is an older home and Diego came up with a creative solution to solve the problem!\n- In the middle of our kitchen remodel, one of our HVAC systems stopped working and needed total replacement.  Lauren quickly diagnosed the issue and then Ben presented us with several options for new systems.  It was good to have choices!\nJamie and JT did the HVAC install and spent a lot of time working in a tight attic in the August heat to place the new air handler.\n- Over two days, Wesley installed the new cooktop and downdraft vent system for the cooktop along with completing all the plumbing renovations and new waterline connections for the sink, dishwasher and refrigerator.  He is very knowledgeable, kept us informed of what he was doing and then showed us all the new turnoffs, shutoffs, etc.   It was a pleasure having him here.\n- The ladies in the office handling scheduling couldn't have been more helpful.\n- We will definitely continue to use the Sentry team in the future!"

(My father is an A/C specialist but at his age I wouldn\u2019t allow him to work.) My system has a slow leak, Which requires adding Freon every 2 to 3 years. Otherwise, the unit worked fine (before this agent touched it.) I realize I\u2019m eventually going to have to replace the unit but not when it works. I wanted the Freon added. All I know is after he left, the unit no longer holds Freon more than 4 days. It\u2019s so sad that finding honest people to do work, these days is almost impossible. Giving this to the Lord."

The technician,, Ryan , arrived as scheduled, carefully inspected the site and made a decision to solve the pipe leak which was previously repaired by another company.  As it turns out, the previous repair was flawed.  Ryan\u2019s 20 years of experience and his communication skill helped me understand the fix.  It was now correctly  repaired.  Ryan\u2019s support with the staff at Eagle not only phoned early on to confirm, sent a text that he was on the way with a map of his route.  Customer service I should rate at 5 stars."

        "text": "I would NOT recommend Eagle Service for plumbing. They replaced a portion of our sewer pipe in our basement that we had been having clogging issues with. The new piping looks excellent and the problem seems to have been fixed. However... I had a couple of issues. They charged me an extra $150 for a 2nd visit that only took 10 minutes for him to confirm the issue (I believe this was refunded after I complained). And worst of all, he did not protect the work area and raw sewage dumped all over our washer and dryer, mop sink, basement walls, etc. I did not see this happen and it ended up being much worse than I thought. I asked him if he was going to clean up before he left, he didn't even sweep up the PVC dust from cutting the pipe. He asked me if I had a mop?? All he did was hose down the area and did NOT do a thorough job cleaning up the raw sewage or disinfecting the area. When I called the office to talk to a manager, they told me they have gotten calls before but that it was not standard for their crew to carry cleaning supplies on their trucks. They did not offer to send someone to clean up the mess. The Servpro quote was twice as much as the plumbing quote. I truly cannot believe they would leave someone's home in such a mess. It's a good thing it was in an unfinished basement!"

BUT several hours after they left, we went outside and noticed they didn\u2019t even use the entrance that\u2019s already there on one side of the house to access the area under my house! Instead the ripped some of my underpinning off!  It looks awful now and it ripped the top of the pieces on both sides away from the house as well! I\u2019ve never even heard of anyone doing that. All they had to do was ask where the entry was. I\u2019m really surprised that any professional company would destroy your property and leave it on the ground without even mentioning it.

Once they came out to diagnose the problem they sent the information in to home warranty indicating that the unit had to be moved from its original location. They REQUIRED that I paid the amount to have it moved PRIOR to them even coming to the house!! Should have been a red flag there. Once they were there, they did  not move the unit instead put the unit in the exact same place that it was originally. They refused to give me any of the $1900.00 that I was out for moving the unit (for which was not done!). Now here we are 3 months later and the unit is not working due to a Freon leak, had they pressure checked the unit they would have noticed that there was a leak. So home warranty sent out another contractor to look at it. It was determined that the location of the unit was not in specs/regulation of ac rules. Also that there was a Freon leak. The home warranty has tried to get Allstar to send them a breakdown of the costs that I was charged for. Allstar refuses to send them anything stated that they destroy everything after 1 month. So now the home warranty does not want to cover to get my unit moved and recharged because I had already paid to have it moved once. A new contractor was contacted to have them move the unit, guess what??? The amount to move the unit is 1900.00 exactly what Allstar charged me to move the unit they would not move!!! 2 weeks with no AC and no end in site to get my unit fixed correctly... Allstar will not return any calls! If they would at least send a breakdown of what they charged me for then home warranty could get someone out to fix my ac. They don't want to send a breakdown to home warranty as they know they DID NOT do the work they charged me for and it would be clearly shown by the location of the unit and the other contractors diagnoses."

Customer service is amazing! He definitely went out of his way to respond about any of my concerns and was so emphatic! He actually cares about his customers well being and that is RARE. He made sure the repairs/replacements were handled for me the same day parts arrived! After 5 years, my home is finally feeling amazing. Thanks to Tony & Everyone who is apart of TSquare!

T Square promised me they'd see me at 11am today, they didn't lie. They looked at the issue, diagnosed it, and fixed it without trying to sell me parts and units that I didn't need.\n\nThey were professional, knowledgeable, and personable. Plenty of people would try to take advantage of the recent heat wave and know that people are desperate for working AC, but that's not how T Square handled it. They were very straightforward, explained the issue once it was diagnosed, and showed the fix. Afterwards, they checked to be sure everything was working, tested the temperature, and made sure I was satisfied with the job.\n\nI can't say enough good things about these guys. I'm glad I found them. Having AC problems is awful, finding good service is usually worse. Do yourself a favor and call T Square. It's too hot to get jerked around by crooks."

He was able to track down which part was faulty and repair it quickly, efficiently, and affordably. But that's not the best part of using T Square. Tony, himself, is delightful. He explained what was wrong in such a way that I really understood. He was so kind to my granddaughter that she wanted him to come to her birthday party! I wholeheartedly recommend T Square Heating and Air."

        "text": "After nearly 30 years in my home I\u2019ve had several recognizable AC companies in town work on my HVAC and more often than not been left disappointed with one thing or another. This company was recommended to me be a friend who had a good experience so I called. It was during the first warm days of spring and everyone was slammed but Taylor made every effort to get to me in a timely manner. The first impression was a knowledgeable and friendly staff with a very professional truck and equipment. I was prepared for the worst but after a thorough inspection it was diagnosed as a bad starter capacitor. The brand that Taylor uses has a 5 year warranty. It\u2019s unheard of for electronic/electric parts to have any warranty but Taylor explained that he insists on providing premium components for his clients and it saves time and money in the long run. Overall they had me back up and cooling off in no time. . Clear and precise communication combined with prompt service (he gave me a ballpark time and then called 30 minutes before arriving) and professional appearances and extremely reasonable pricing made me feel like I have found a HVAC I can depend on for all my future needs. I can\u2019t speak highly enough about how satisfied I am with the work and new relationship. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of work on there systems.\nA+ experience and I will use them again!"

Taylor and his team were prompt, courteous and handled the job in a timely manner at an affordable price.  He didn't come in over budget and stuck to his original prices even after a few items were added to complete the job right.   We run a wedding and event venue so a clean look was KEY and they did great disguising electrical lines, condenser lines, and more.   We can't thank them enough for their work.  While we hope to do business with Taylor and his crew again, we doubt we will need to do anything more than routine maintenance as he hooked us up with all new units!\n\nThanks Taylor and Fresh Air HVAC"

        "text": "We have been using Perfect Service for a few years and the service was decent. However, I most recent service (duct cleaning) has us reconsidering to continue to use them. First, we were told the duct cleaning service would take about 4 hours to complete. The technicians that came out to complete the duct cleaning \"completed\" the service in 2 hours so we checked with them and asked if they completed the work in each room as they said they would when they first arrived. They said \"yes, we did the work in all rooms.\" After they left, we double checked the rooms and saw that all room did not seem to be done because there was lint/matter still caked in the vents. I called Perfect Service about this issue and was told by Allen that he would have someone to come out a double check the ducts to make sure the work was indeed completed. No one returned my call so over the past 2-3 weeks I have been calling only to be transferred to a telephone line that one answers.\n\nSecond thing- when requesting the duct service work and getting a quote, Allen told us that we could finance our purchase. We provided the info (e.g., social security number) and quickly told him that we would rather pay the bill in cash, not have credit pulled. He was okay with that and told us the instructions for paying the guys who came out to complete the duct cleaning. To our surprise, my husband received a credit alert within minutes of Allen running his credit without his authorization despite us telling Allen we would pay in cash and Allen giving us instructions to pay in cash. I called Perfect Service after we realized what happened only to be told by Allen \"I entered your social security number but didn't go to the next screen.\" A week or so later, a credit card from Wells Fargo arrived in the mail! Nothing could be done about Allen's mistake. Now my husband has a credit inquiry and credit card that he didn't ask for."

This young man greeted me with eye contact, firmly shook my hand and introduced himself. I was kinda blown away by his professional approach and appearance. He explained why he was there and went to work. He showed me the before and after footage . I couldn't have more impressed with his work. I would like for him to be the tech to do my spring service if at all possible. Who knows, he may be a supervisor by then. Thank you for a great job, my man Romello Miller."

We gathered several quotes, and Perfect Service wasn't the cheapest to the dollar - they were actually the second most affordable option we received. But for us, it was a no-brainier to choose Perfect Service and work with Kyle Kressig; there is so, so much value added to having a company you actually enjoy working with and having peace of mind knowing the work is done correctly. He was the friendliest rep we met with, the most polite, and the most professional. What sold me on Perfect Air was he offered me a whole spread of options we could choose from and each one was something we could actually use - there weren't any lowball or extravagant options - we actually had multiple choices that were all applicable to us! It was great, actually having some agency in what we could pick. Kyle worked out a fair deal for us in the end, and we even opted to add on a full duct cleaning service too. The duct cleaning is important to note, because he actually opened up our unit and did a full inspection, and found mildew growth that our previous company had absolutely failed to find despite us paying for them to come out twice a year for \"seasonal inspections.\" We're both so happy we can, literally, breath a sigh of relief since we have a toddler at home. Install was lightning fast, and so considerate of noise that our toddler actually napped through the entire installation despite his room being directly above the work. It was genuinely cleaner down there when they were done, too, which is always a nice bonus.\n\nWe're fully on board to have Kyle and Perfect Service be our go-to HVAC company moving forward. I sincerely wish we had found them years ago when we bought the house, instead of just going along with what the previous owners had used. Big thanks to Kyle."

The second time (yesterday), he checked our HVAC systems out. He pointed out some items to watch. When I mentioned a hard rain caused the flu pipe going through the roof, to leak once recently. He went up on my steep roof and called around the pipe and roof penetration as well as around the cap. He did not charge got me that!  My previous HVAC people kept promising to get someone to put a new cap on but I finally found someone to replace the cap and had no problems until recently."

They were courteous, on time, explained everything, answered all of our questions and even gave us tips on how to make our units work the best for us, and even stayed longer to make sure everything was perfect before they left. We got quotes from multiple Heating & Air companies and Cody\u2019s quote BY FAR was the best and most fair price! So fair that we added on a water heater as well! I HIGHLY recommend Cody and his team! Five stars from us!"

I have a home warranty company that called them to my home to fix some ducts that fell and were cooling my crawl space instead of my home. They are 56 years old. It's bound to happen. Well, because I had cable installed three months ago, Charlie told them that the cable guy must have knocked the ducts loose and that's why they fell. This is a flat out lie. You cannot prove that someone knocked them down unless you saw them do it. Believe me I would have called a long time ago if that was the case.There is other duct work that has fallen nowhere near where the cables were installed, but those won't be covered either because it's all the same system.  The ducts fell only in the last week or so. Charlie was never at my home to do the inspection and the person who was at my home said that it was due to old age. But because Charlie said otherwise only looking at pictures, my home warranty company will not be covering the cost. Now I will have to hire someone on my own, and you bet it will not be One Call. Not to mention their prices are much higher than most anyway."

Each year we would call a different company that over promised and under delivered. One company suggested adding an additional air duct which we did but did'nt solve the problem. Another company recommended installing an additional return duct. We did but saw little improvement. Another company suggested adding dampers and a ceiling fan which we did, but it still didn't work.\n\nFinally we said as much as we have spent over the years we would invest in a new unit. Most companies wanted to add two units to our house or one and a mini-split. Brian suggested adding an air duct in the place where all other companies said it couldn't be done and just replace the one unit with a 14 SEER unit. He also mentioned there was no need for the dampers because we already had adjustable vents. He installed the air duct and new unit in 3 hours and our upstairs feels just as good as the rest of the house. Brian was very professional, punctual and polite. I highly recommend Peak Performance!"

        "text": "Horrible experience.  I called about a clogged kitchen sink and had a 1430 appointment scheduled for Friday. I called 30-45 minutes after the appointment because the repairman had not shown up or called.  He ended up being over 3 hours late.  He spent a little over an hour snaking and plunging the sink (both things that I told him I had been doing repeatedly the last 24-48 hours). He didn\u2019t have anything fixed, charged $175 and we scheduled another appointment for Sunday at 0700.  This time he was over 4 hours late. He spent the first hour and a half doing the exact same two things he did on Friday that didn\u2019t work.  He then needlessly cut the pipe under the sink that he had already disconnected in order to snake it and had to go get materials to repair it.  He was gone for an hour.  He repaired it after coming back and then went into the attic to try and snake the clog from another direction.  He said he was going to use a drain bladder to try and clear the clog and would need a 100\u2019 hose, which I had and offered.  He instead left again for well over an hour.  He came back with a brand-new garden hose and bladder and had the clog cleared in about 15 minutes.  I was charged another $750 because he was there for \u201c5 hours\u201d.  This job could have been completed in a fraction of the time, but I guess when you\u2019re charging by the hour, even the hours you aren\u2019t actually at my home, you take your sweet time and try to look busy.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to their other services, but if you have a plumbing issue, save your money, and sanity, and hire someone else."

They were timely, called beforehand, they were nice and did a good job working all afternoon in the heat to get our unit installed. But I especially want to praise the way they handled the snake that was in the crawl space with them lol. It wasn't poisonous, but they insisted it be gone before they continued working haha, which I understand, since it was right above their heads. But instead of refusing to work or freaking out and killing it, they gently removed it with my pitchfork and took it to the woods near my house (where I am sure it patiently waited for them to leave so she could come back). They handled it so well, laughing and joking around, and I am very grateful they were okay with just temporarily removing her. I really appreciated them not taking her life unnecessarily or insisting I remove it myself before they continued. Because while I don't mind snakes being around, I was not excited about the prospect of trying to remove it. Anyways, they got right back to work in there, knowing there could be others, and knowing the one they had removed was probably trying to make it's way back!"

It is easy to set up an appointment for services. The technician, Adam, always calls to let you know he is on the way and when he will arrive. He arrives within the scheduled time and performs the services in a courteous, friendly, knowledgeable and professional manner with good communication about his services.

He said we needed a new unit and went on a sales pitch on interest free units. Guin's tech said only the wires needed to be replaced because there was a short and let us know of a potential fire hazard. He said it was a simple job and got it up and running. That was over 2 years ago. This time a capacitor went bad and the tech got it up and running. He said the 2nd unit AC for the upstairs has a leaky coil and qouted me a bit over 3k for the repair. Still happy with the work on the primary unit. But I will get a second opinion on the 2nd unit."

During our first year of owning our home, we had many different plumbers, contractor, electricians come out to give us quotes and help us some of our house trouble mysteries. I would venture to say that no other company was worth our time as much as Guin was. Wendell knows our home inside and out now. Everyone we spoke with was very knowledgeable about older homes and how plumbing technology has changed over the years. We are pretty loyal to Guin now and hope that others are encouraged to use their services from this review!"

The technician, Justin, was punctual, polite, professional, and most importantly, competent in servicing our systems. I signed up for the pm service agreement because I\u2019m confident that they will be able to continue to provide that same level of service and standard of care."

Decided to wait till next morning and called before they opened. Was able to talk with a real person who could say they could schedule me around lunch that day (again, this is before they even opened). Joe called and was enroute by about 10:30 AM. Diagnosed a bad capacitor immediately, had the part on the truck and was done in no time. Also courteous and friendly. Price was reasonable and solved the problem. I plan to use Steagall for my Carrier systems in the future."

He also checked other areas to make sure there weren't additional problems. He explained everything so well so that I could understand the functionality of the system and where the problem was. A part had to be ordered and he said Stegall would send someone out ASAP. I requested that he come back personally. They managed to get the part, and David, back to our house for the installation the next day. So happy with their response time, their professionalism, and David's attention to detail and genuine friendliness. Thank you for getting us COLD air in the Alabama July heat!"

Very professional and friendly, Ken immediately began to perform the maintenance service due on my units.\n\nI knew my upstairs heat pump system was in need of replacement, and Ken explained the problems with it, and recommended a replacement system that would be best suited for the space.\n\nKen determined the problem with my ice machine, installed the replacement part needed, and had my machine making ice, in less than an hour.\n\nI mentioned to Ken, the water pressure in my house had never been sufficient, since I built my house in 2005, and he contacted a co-worker from Stegall's plumbing division, and upon his prompt arrival, they determined my pressure regulator needed replacing.  Stegall had the replacement part on their truck.  The new regulator was quickly installed, the pressure adjusted, and my water pressure problems were solved throughout my entire house, for the first time, since I built my house, 11 years ago.\n\nI would highly recommend Stegall's services to anyone in need of HVAC, or plumbing service.  Ken Speer is a professional, knows his business, and promptly resolved 3 major issues within my home, and did so, in just a few hours.  I couldn't be happier with his customer service.

No one could help with this purchase and install - all said that the crawl space was too small for a new unit. However, Stegall said, \"Yes!\" The team of Jo, Todd and Justin dismantled the existing unit piece by piece and fit the new unit in this tight space. It is anyways easier to say no but so glad that Stegall said YES! It works like a charm - thanks Stegall!"

I assumed I would be looking at a huge bill because I have had similar issues at a different residence, and Norrell charged me $600, 3 separate times over a number of yrs. so I figured it was going to be the same ole same ole. But was wrong!!!! The technician that came out explained everything he was looking for and what I needed to look for and do to prolong my AC unit. Turns out I was not doing maintenance for the unit that I was not aware of. He fixed it quickly and in no time the unit was running properly. My wife was super excited and happy......happy wife =happy life. Lol \ud83d\ude02"

In addition to charging me for a diagnostic fee, I was charged an additional $125.00 for a \"leak check\". Isn't the diagnostic a part of checking to see what is wrong with the unit ... including checking for leaks? I would not recommend this company AT ALL. They are ripoffs and I am taking them to court if my money is not returned. I will be contacting them on Monday about this matter."

Coolray sent Devante out to have a look at my furnace and he broke everything down for me without saying a whole bunch of jargon that I wouldn\u2019t understand and trying to confuse me. He couldn\u2019t fix my furnace as it\u2019s super outdated, but he got Mr. Reid to come out and break down my options for me and he also didn\u2019t beat around the bush. He gave it to me straight and didn\u2019t run any crazy numbers. They are both very knowledgeable about what they do and how to go about fixing my furnace and I really felt like I made a great decision calling them for help! I look forward to my continued business with them!"

After my long time plumber treated me rudely because I was in a panic, wouldn't come out and told me to get another plumber,  I called Coolray. They were out in less than 15 minutes after I called.  Sam fixed my leaky gas line valve within 30 minutes and I was able to get my gas cut back on and not have to endure a 27 degree night with no heat.  I highly recommend them. Very efficient, fast, professional and polite. I will use them for more plumbing issues in the future."

He fixed the unit and now it is working great. What I love most is he was very friendly, kind, and very well mannered. He did not try and overcharge me. They have a rating scale of 1 thru 5.

We had to call and call. Wish we would have gone to someone else. The guy was friendly and did his job but this company is a disappointment.  The work was warranty work. But we got charged 1100 dollars for the service guy being here 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I cant even. It would cost less to go to school to become a tech. The whole experience was disappointing. We will go somewhere else. Also no one told us that if we went with a carrier covered company it would have been paid for. Nothing but scam artists here."

We had also noticed hot and cool spots on the  upstairs floor serviced by the system. Daniel conducted a thorough inspection of the old system and our duct work, then provided a clear explanation of the various issues followed by highly detailed estimates for replacing the old system. He patiently answered myriad questions, including a couple that required a bit of research. He provided a second set of estimates for a different system to help us stay within budget. He made sure replacements were Energy Star and offered excellent warranties and financing w/Greensky. He was able to schedule the installation when we needed it and his team were on time, professional, and cleaned up when they were finished! Communication with the office staff was also professional and prompt. Daniel and the others at TempPro earned our trust and we will be hiring them for biannual maintenance and any future HVAC repairs/installations. A-plus on BBB and glowing reviews of Daniel on Google are well-deserved."

A night and day difference since their work. They knew their stuff and was able to pass some along. Thanks them and their crew."

Three installers arrived and did, what I would consider, a very good job on replacing both the inside air handler and the outside condenser unit. They made several changes on the fly so the install would look right. They even put insulation on a pipe so it wouldn't drip on the floor since it wasn't over the drain pan. While TemperaturePro wasn't the cheapest quote, I did get the most for my dollar spent. I even received a call from the home office that another person is going to come out for a final review of the install. That's real customer service."

The team I dealt with were great at communicating the work involved with frequent updates and before, during and after pictures. The work was completed in a timely manner and priced very fair. We are required to three bid projects such as these and Temperature  Pro was the best over all hands down. Would use again in the future. Side note, I only have four stars because I feel there is always room for improvement no matter how great the service."

Tristan, the service tech, was very friendly and obviously takes his job seriously. Our unit is 16 years old and many other companies would have seized on that to try and sell me a new unit.

        "text": "UPDATE:\nSo I got a call from Grissom Brother's on yesterday. The customer service rep expressed the company's concern with my customer service experience. Apparently I was overcharged. I should not have been charged the diagnostic fee once I accepted service. She also explained that I received the best product for my situation and that the price was on par with receiving quality product and labor. She surprisingly rectified the situation by giving me a huge discount for my trouble instead of just refunding the diagnostic fee. I really appreciated that! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI must say, superior customer service, as I received from Grissom Brother's on yesterday is priceless! Based on their integrity alone,  I'd not only highly recommend them but use them again.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nSo I just had the capacitor on my AC unit fixed. It took the guy at most 15 minutes to fix. The cost was about $355 plus the $85 diagnostic fee. This is a bit pricy for not even 30 minutes worth of work with a part that is not that expensive. Online research revealed that an appropriate price for this work is between $100 and $150, if you choose not to do it yourself. And if that's not enough, it's extra to use a credit card. Wow!!!\n\nI guess I shouldn't have been trying to get the air fixed so fast and through the warranty; which didn't help because the part wasn't even covered. And since it was going to cost me $85 anyway, I went ahead with the service...big mistake \ud83d\ude15. I mean, the dude showed me a price list on his phone; I should have known something since he didn't have an actual one to show me...smh. This is the first time reviews let me down. One of their customers gets an $11,000 quote from a competitor but the problem is fixed for less than $100 by them. Guess that wasn't a real review \"fake news\". \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude44\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude12\n\nOn a positive note, although the technician spelled my name completely wrong on the invoice, he was nice, fast talking and moving but nice."

I started with their service in 2013 when an a/c unit malfunctioned at my home. Since then, I have used them for generator maintenance, ductwork, electrical, switches, and Garage heating and cooling. Superb product that - although not cheap - is the very worth the expenditure and saves money in the long run every single time. If I could give them six stars, I would."

We basically had an idea on what the issue was but Polar Bear kept saying it was something different. This tech found and resolved the issue right away. Will definitely use them again and highly recommend. Thank you very much for the work and saving us from another headache"

They all used \"bandaids\" for a temporary fix.  This guy checked everything thoroughly and finally found a wiring defect that came from the factory.  Can't believe no other technician could see this since they are trained to recognize issues like this.  I would highly recommend this company.  Hopefully every technician is as thorough as the one we had.  Thanks Mr Lamberson!"

He got it to finally blow cool air and walked my husband through the regular maintenance and type of filter and where to order it. He didn\u2019t leave until after 10 and only charged $150! My husband was so afraid for me to call someone with the chance of having to spend thousands of dollars that we didn\u2019t have. This place has integrity and I am so thankful he came out that late on a Friday night. We won\u2019t use anyone else other than service tech from now on."

Special thanks to Robert, Brandon, Carlos and Reggie. They worked long hours to get us back in our home in 2 days. They went above and beyond to take care of our home and made sure they shut my gates each time they went in and out so my 2 dogs wouldn\u2019t get out and even did a couple of extra things while they were under the house already. Those little things meant a lot to our family."

I had a problem with my unit and originally had another company that came out, the result was a quote for 7,000 for a new unit after I just spent 1,500 with them last year. Thankfully I got a referral for Service Tech Inc. this company is amazing! They came out and assessed the situation, the other company had something wired up wrong. Service tech recognized the issue and got me running. I do believe that this company's honesty is outstanding. I paid more for the other (Holland) company to come out wire up something wrong and give me a 7,000 dollar quote, then I did for Service Tech Inc charge me to actually fix my unit. I finally feel like I found a company I can trust, that will not take advantage of me. Thank you Service Tech Inc."

Arthur meet me at my house and got my AC cooling my house! He was quick to diagnose the issue, explained what was wrong, and got to work making sure everything was running well. Afterward, Karen called and checked to see if everything was cooling off. This was the best HVAC service I\u2019ve used. I 100% recommend using them if you need fast and dependable service."

They simply wanted to get it corrected right and to our satisfaction.\n\nEveryone I've had contact with from the office personnel to their service manager, and their technicians have always been top notch.\n\nWhile I can't recall the various techs over the years, I would like to commend Harry Wheeler, who handled an AC issue last July and just this week, James Ollis and Jared who handled a heat pump issue.\n\nHighly recommend One Source."

As we sit down to get an estimate of what I needed that quickly changed. He was knowledgeable and very professional but very down to earth and able to explain everything with ease. He sold me and my wife a new unit, had us financed, and at my door ready to install the next morning! Very pleased. Only thing they could have done better was tell me it was free!!

He not only fixed the problem but took the time to explain what went wrong and how he was solving it. A small hiccup popped up later, but One Source didn\u2019t miss a beat\u2014they sent someone out the very next day to ensure everything was perfect.\n\nWhat really blew me away was their commitment to customer care. These guys aren\u2019t just in it for the paycheck\u2014they\u2019re passionate about their work and genuinely want to make sure you\u2019re taken care of. In a world where good service is hard to find, One Source Heating and Cooling stands out as a beacon of excellence. 10/10 recommend!"

We had a generator installed and it has never came on automatically like it is supposed to. After having THREE technicians come out and make no attempt to fix it I was livid and wanted to talk to the owner. Whoever I talked was also very rude and only offered to send yet another tech. After having the electric go out this morning I called AGAIN because the website says they are open 24hours, but it\u2019s just an answering service that says they are not to send any messages before 7 am. Google was where I had to turn to so I could figure out how to start the generator manually.\n\nI think they know why this generator won\u2019t auto start and just don\u2019t want to fix it or replace it with a generator that actually works properly.\n\nThis is not my first generac that I have owned and have never had any problems with them. This one was installed by One Souce but has not operated as it should.\n\nThree technicians and over six months since it\u2019s been installed and One Source still has not fixed the problem and they just say they don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with it!\n\nThe technicians were friendly but that does not justify a good rating because the generator still does not operate properly"

The competitor gave me an overpriced repair estimate and told me it could take 2-3 week estimate to get the parts.  The tech then suggested I purchase a new system.\n\nThe One Source tech checked out the system and found a solenoid starter needed to be replaced and the compressor was fine.  He got the system running in a matter of minutes.  I appreciate the quick response after I called and the honesty and great work done."

It was an unexpected expense for us but the pricing was super reasonable and they were able to get it installed within 2 days of our initial call. I think the most important part was that Tyler, who came out on the initial call, explained everything to me. Gave me several options as how to proceed. And he didnt pressure me into it.\n\nThen Tristan and his crew (Blair and Brett) were awesome. Very polite and courteous in our home. They cleaned up EVERYTHING and I think they actually cleaned out my garage better than it was before they installed the unit.\n\nI always thought their Tighty Whitey ad campaign was hilarious. Glad I called them. They did a great job."

After a diagnostic the determination was leaking Freon.  Once the exact location of the leak was determined it was immediately fixed and was up and running again.

Joe at 3D was fantastic - gave us so much helpful information and provided 3 complete written options for us to consider - and included special financing options available. Chris and crew did an outstanding job of installing our system and the crew that did the duct cleaning was thorough and professional. From start to finish, working with 3D Air Services was a wonderful experience during a very stressful situation. We will never call anyone else for a/c, heating and duct services, and would highly recommend them! Thanks so much, 3D - we couldn't be happier! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaf"

Brian Skelton , company owner, came out the day after my call, evaluated the job and provided a best guess estimate for the proposed task\nThe following day a team of two technicians  arrived at 0800 , as agreed. Within 4 hours the old vent box was removed, a new floor frame between the joists was constructed, a new box placed and large duct connected to the existing AC/ Heating unit and new ,sturdy floor grate placed( and thermostat repositioned)\n\nThe Skelton team were most professional and efficient.  The job site was completely cleaned and everything double checked to be sure everything was done to my satisfaction and functioning well. An immediate follow up call to me by company owner was appreciated.\n\nThe total cost was $960.00 based on labor and materials , which was as expected per initial estimate\n\nMy five star rating was completely deserved based on professionalism, punctuality, job done, and charge. I definitely recommend this company and will use them again.\n\nDoug Tilt"

Matthew was the technician assigned to my job, and he did an outstanding job from start to finish.\n\nMatthew was punctual, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable. He not only fixed the immediate issue but also conducted a thorough inspection of all the plumbing in my home. He provided a detailed evaluation and presented me with options for future improvements and maintenance, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nHis attention to detail and commitment to quality were evident in his work. The plumbing issue was fixed quickly, and Matthew made sure everything was cleaned up before he left.

I was impressed by how well Jordan explained the difference between how the various parts were supposed to work, at what power levels, expected functionality of systems, etc.\n\nWhen the matter called for discussion re: repairs and options, Jordan was extremely thorough in explaining all of my choices.

I called Browns based on the fantastic positive reviews I read. They sent out Cody and Chris to help me and it was by far a superior experience in comparison to the techs representing other companies. They were extremely professional, knowledgeable, kind, and worked hard to get my heat back up and running. I will NEVER call another Heating & Air company.

I more than recommend them if you have any hvac issues. Top notch customer service in all areas!"

The technicians were super thorough and made sure to look over everything, even beyond the obvious problems.\n\nI was happy with the technicians work, but I was pretty taken aback when the invoice came. They were very upfront about the diagnosis/trouble shooting fee, however the cost of the labor/parts for the repairs wasn't discussed until the bill came. Had I known they were going to charge $400 in labor to change my 2 overflow switches, I would have just paid for the diagnosis and spent the 10 minutes to do it myself."

I got a card in the mail for a Free-Bruary HVAC SYSTEM, buy an A/C & the furnace is free. I needed it. I need it like I needed air in my lungs. I had to call.\nIt was time to get some Heat \ud83d\udd25 in my home. And eventually some air. I knew it and so did God. Now, in steps my Guardian Angel \ud83d\ude07, Mr. Jake Wint representing Wilbur\u2019s Air Conditioning/Heating/Plumbing. I chose Wilbur\u2019s because,\nMr. Wilbur put my HVAC unit in my home 1997. He is a good man and  helped me keep the unit all these years at prices I could afford. One time I could not afford it and Mr. Wilbur worked a payment plan for me without having to be financed. But it was time and being without heat, I had gotten all my money out of too. I needed immediate help. I was cold but I did not tell a soul not even my children. I thought I could make it with these two spac space heaters confined to just one room in my home. The weather dropped to a hard  freezing \ud83e\udd76 though and felt like it too. My thoughts froze.\ud83e\udd76 I was aching because I had chills. Jake wasn\u2019t going leave me until he could arrange heat \ud83d\udd25 for me.\nI\u2019m not as healthy as I want to be. I go to Chemotherapy for fours hours twice a month a Lung disease that has no cure. I changed my scheduled intravenous infusion time to later that afternoon and as you can see, I\u2019m smiling cause I\u2019m getting heat. \ud83d\udd25.  I\u2019m autoimmune and a mere cold could kill me. It\u2019s was time.  I had plan on getting other company estimates. But Jake\u2019s, professional, compassionate, attentive and kind ways, sold me. No need for the others. Plus he spoke with Mr. Wilbur on my behalf and Mr. Wilbur made me an offer I  could not refuse.Thank you Mr. Wilbur.  I have not Financed anything in years. When my Husband passed, I just stopped buying things, thanking God for surviving well on a Widow\u2019s money after Husband\u2019s salary died with him. I didn\u2019t think no one would Finance me. But Jake sat and stayed with me and helped me fill out the first Bank application and then the second. He sat and sat until I got approved over the phone something I had never done in these 71 years of my life. I always go inside and plead pitifully. We both fist bumping in celebration \ud83e\udd73 . Jake arranged plans for ordering the equipment right then and there and told me some one would be here the next day  and they would do a good job. And it happened as he promised and they did indeed do a good job. I GOT HEAT \ud83d\udd25. God is good. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Thank you Wilbur\u2019s for still being good after all these years. Thank you Jake for sticking with me. I will refer Wilbur\u2019s to VILLAGE of Family, Friends and Acquaintances for HVAC. It\u2019s been a long time since I smelled and felt heat \ud83d\udd25. In my home. I love it.\u2665\ufe0f\n\nMrs. Cynthia Kellum \u263a\ufe0f"

The sinks had started draining slowly and backing up. He told us that draining and replacing an element, this heater had two, would cost more than than just replacing the 11 year old water heater. We are choosing to do that after Christmas since it is working, just not as well as it should. He also fixed the drains in the double sink and dishwasher. Johnathan seemed very knowledgeable, was honest and very friendly and didn't seem to mind all of our questions. The price for just checking the water heater and fixing the drain was definitely pricier than I thought it should be, but I admit to not knowing what professional plumbing services cost these days. I was very happy with the experience overall."

The Technician, Connor, who was extremely pleasant diagnosed and serviced my A/C unit with the description of pump refrigerant into outdoor unit for containment.  Install a liquid line filter drier and piston metering device.  Properly evacuate the system and release refrigerant being contained in outdoor unit. After two months from servicing, I noticed on June 6th the upstairs A/C unit was leaking a profusion amounts of water, permeating through the ceiling which caused the sheetrock to crack in multiple places.  Wilbur\u2019s Service Manager, Matthew, came out the next day.  He did a great job addressing the mistake of the technician and recognizing the technician did not properly clear the line.  I call the office on the next day to report a claim to repair my ceiling damages, no one would give me an answer.  I have called the office repeatedly since June 7th, but they avoid assisting me with this request or given me a direct answer.  The response from Helen has been, Mr. Wilbur will call you back. I have been waiting over three weeks.  This has been a disastrous experience.  I am very dissatisfied with Wilbur\u2019s delayed follow up to return my call and resolve this issue."

Recently, we had an issue with clogged drains that would not clear in our kitchen sink and our shower.  We also had a broken faucet for one of our outdoor water faucets.  We called Wilbur\u2019s the morning that our sink backed up.  The receptionist was prompt and efficient.  She asked their scheduler to call us to set up a time for service.  We were very pleased that they could send someone the same day to fix our problem.  Will Doonan arrived in the mid afternoon. He assessed our problem issues and advised us of the cost of the service up-front.  We agreed and he began working to resolve our issues.  In the course of his work, he also discovered that the regulator and the shut-off valve were worn out and needed to be replaced.  We had previously  been aware of the regulator issue, but had been putting off fixing it.  We asked for an estimate of the cost and his price was less than previous estimates that we had received.  We agreed to have this repair added to our work order.\nWill worked efficiently, professionally, and meticulously.  He came equipped with all of the parts needed to make our repairs.  He worked for several hours, taking real pride in getting the job done right.  We were very pleased with the job he did for us.  I also want to say that the work he did to replace the regulator and the broken outdoor faucet was so meticulous.  He had to drill a hole in the wall to fit the new parts, but he took extra time and effort to completely seal the areas where the hole had been.  Replacing the regulator has made showering a new experience!  The water pressure is the best we have had in 30+ years of living here.  I highly recommend Wilber\u2019s Air Conditioning, Heating and Plumbing!  They do quality work at reasonable prices!"

Found the circuit board online in under 45 seconds, no exaggeration it took under one minute. To install a plug and play circuit board they quoted $800 and that's without the part cost. They said I could buy the part myself ($200) and they would install it for $800.\n\nI understand that the water heater was old and why they recommended to replace it, that's fine. But the prices they quoted are insane. I definitely felt like they were trying to take advantage of my lack of knowledge."

I kid you not, we had techs from other companies come out 15 times, we called the manufacturer, had multiple parts replaced under warranty, it was a mess. No one could figure it out. After working on it every few weeks for a year and getting nowhere, it was just getting to be a joke how bad it was. But then someone told me about Scott with Airloc. He came out, got in the weeds with it, did some serious sleuthing, and got to the bottom of the issue. He charged us a fair price and he took a big thing off my plate. Very grateful for him and his company."

Extra challenging as it included a water-based Aquatherm heat exchanger for the winter use. Airloc was in and out in a day, with zero problems as of a few weeks later. Also, Scott helped me limp the old system along a few weeks while we unsuccessfully tried to get American Home Shield to live up to at least part of our home warranty. Too hot to wait another month on AHS, but Airloc pricing was fair and quality of installation top notch.\nNovember 2020 review - Scott worked up all the estimates I requested for conventional and heat pump units. Airloc installed the complete replacement conventional Trane gas furnace and air conditioning components, even the blower all for less than the \"Big Boys\" around Birmingham. Two months on, have used both the heat and A/C a few times each with excellent results. Electric and gas bills have come way down. Highest recommendation on all counts."

Scott took the time to review our building plans for finishing a basement, taking additional measurements, spending time in the space and then making multiple recommendations to allow us to make the best decision for our family and for our needs.  Then during the installation process, he let us know when he will be working on which aspect of the installation.  When an instance comes up that requires him to get additional fittings, he let us know what he needed and when he would be back to finish up - and he followed through and finished ahead of his initial schedule!   Airlock had finished installation of our two other units during the construction phase of our home when the contractor's HVAC guys did not show up - even though it wasn't the manufacturer he represents!  He has always been diligent and honest in all the work he has done for our family.  We would give Scott and Airlock more than 5 stars if Google gave us that option!  We will be using Airlock for years to come for regular maintenance and system upgrades.  Thanks again for a fantastic job!  The robotics team especially thanks you!!"

I knew right away that we were in good hands! On day two he called and within 3-5 minutes we worked out the financing and on day three installation! Scott really goes above and beyond with great service. Even when faced with old wiring issues in my home for the new thermostat he stayed longer than planned to finish the job. Before Airloc we used to be on with Brown\u2019s and when we got our quotes from them they were ludacris (not even for the top of the line system) and definitely trying to take advantage of us, warning us that we only had a few days to make our decision or loose the \u201cloyal customer discount\u201d. Airloc\u2019s prices are on point (even for the top of the line). They are honest, fair and choosing them for my heating and cooling needs was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made! We are so thankful for Scott! We will always entrust our HVAC and Heating system at this home and also any future home with Scott at Airloc! You should too! Call them now!"

He installed the thermostats, explained our system, and was professional, smart, and fast. Airloc is an awesome family business serving the Birmingham region."

He felt like he knew what it was, and said he would be out around 1pm. He ended up being able to come at 10:30 am - Praise Jesus! He ran and got a part after confirming what it was and had the air back on by 1pm.\n\nI\u2019ve used some of the other HVAC folks in town but never had prompt and responsive service like this.

On a recommendation, I called Plus One and Mark promptly visited my home and emailed me a written estimate for my insurance company. My insurance issued me a check within days of the event and I called Plus One to tell them to commence the work.  Within 10 days of my original call, my unit was replaced and I had the opportunity to meet three amazing young men who performed the work. Gadge, Luis, and Devin were so efficient and professional during their time in and out of my home. They were just downright nice and courteous. They worked constantly and they worked well with each other toward the same goal. This is a first class company and I intend to work with them for any future needs. Great job!"

        "text": "We moved into this house 4 years ago (built in \u201890) and knew the HVAC units were old with some parts being from the original build. Our ductwork was full of mold and our electric bill was through the roof. We knew it was finally time to replace them and had four different companies come out and give estimates. We were the most impressed with Daniel at Plus One. They pointed out where our original install was designed improperly and completely redid both our upstairs and downstairs systems including all new duct work. We also felt like their pricing was more reasonable than some other companies we received quotes from.\n\nThe new systems are very nice and we now have a dual fuel heat pump for both floors of the house. Gadge and Myles did most of the install work and we couldn\u2019t have been happier with their work. They did a great install and were very professional and hardworking whenever they were here.\n\nIf you are looking for a company and are not sure who to choose because every company is giving you different answers on what your home needs I recommend going with Plus One. They take a scientific approach to ensuring all of your ductwork is sized correctly for proper airflow. They installed dampers and adjusted the airflow in each room to meet the needs of the space. Most of this stuff other companies didn\u2019t offer to do.\n\nThe new system works more efficiently and is quieter than our old system. We also had the AprilAire whole home air cleaner installed to help with our allergies. The ductwork was really well done and passed pressure testing with flying colors. Our old ductwork was really leaky and had so many holes in it. This new ductwork is made from sheet metal wrapped in insulation and will last for decades.\n\nThey customized the install to meet our home\u2019s specific needs and didn\u2019t insist on one size fits all. We will continue to use Plus One to service our new systems for life. We had a great experience with everyone we dealt with at Plus One. They definitely earned a five star review."

I called them at 7:15am on a Monday morning and they were at my house by 8:30am to investigate. They checked out the whole system which involved crawling through a super tight crawl space under my house and they even took it apart to check inside the vents. Turned out there was no critter (seems like it was on the outside of the system) but they did a thorough job. How much did it cost? They said it was free since they didn\u2019t find anything. I couldn\u2019t believe it. There\u2019s no way you could get me to crawl under my house for free. I couldn\u2019t be more happier with my experience. I will continue to use them exclusively for all my hvac needs."

They are trustworthy, professional, show up on time, clean up afterwards and get our units working.  Most recently we had no A/C after a storm and they quickly determined it was a blown fuse and thermostat and replaced both of these under warranty.   At another location during routine maintenance they identified an issue with the compressor on 1 of the units and again replaced that under warranty.  Highly recommend Cool Breeze for any of your HVAC needs!"

They are on time, respectful and very knowledgeable, and (if you are interested) will give you a play-by-play of what needs to be repaired, how they diagnose issues, etc.  HVAC work can be expensive; Cool Breeze will give you the best price possible and help source financing for big projects.  Cool Breeze will be my Go-To for all things HVAC from now on."

Court, the owner, came right out after hours and tried fixing our leaking 17 y/o unit. The leak returned a week later and of all the options Court gave us we decided to replace it. Tony and Mike installed unit the next day and in no time we were cool again. GREAT company, honest and kind people and willing to work w financing. HIGHLY recommend Cool Breeze!"

They came to my rescue from a referral, one referral that I\u2019ll always be grateful for! These men from Coolbreeze, figured my problem out pretty quickly, when others couldn\u2019t. They amazed me with their professionalism, determination, and true dedication to helping me. They went above and beyond. I am truly blessed to call them my new and forever HVAC company!! We had mold issues from a flashing leak, which filled an air duct up with water. They figured out the problem and were immediately on it. I didn\u2019t know the next step to take, so they walked me through the process.  I couldn\u2019t have done this without them! They installed two dehumidifiers in my home, so we will never have to go through the growth of mold again. They are my HVAC guys, but they honestly became family through this. That\u2019s just how incredible this company is! They are there for the customer! I give them a10/10! They are trustworthy, hardworking, professional, honest, and make an incredible team. If you are looking for a new HVAC company, look no further\u2026Coolbreeze is the real deal, as I\u2019ve previously stated. I\u2019m not an easy person to please, so for me to recommend a company this strongly, it says a lot. Call them! You won\u2019t be disappointed!!"

        "text": "I've used Cool Breeze for several home projects since buying my 1960s house a few years ago and have been very pleased with each one. When both my ancient AC unit and furnace died the first 6 months I was in the house, Court came out immediately and had me back up and running in a matter of hours. He was very honest that my AC unit was on its last legs and later showed me ways I could do some minor filter cleaning for the furnace to keep it up and running as long as possible without having to depend on (or paying) someone coming out to my house at all hours when its very old safety switches tripped.\n\nit's also been my long-time dream to live in a house with a fireplace, and last summer Court came out in the middle of August and September heat to install a gas line and top-quality gas fireplace for me in my previously cosmetic fireplace. Even though it doesn't get that cold here in the winters, I have thoroughly enjoyed it every time I've used it and have had zero issues with either warmth or functionality from the fireplace installation. It's unbelievably cozy!\n\nFinally, at the beginning of this summer, my AC unit finally gave up the permanent ghost, and aside from a minor dispatch issue where my call was not relayed until a few days later, once he knew of my issue Court immediately came out, quoted me a price $1,000 less than the competition wanted, and very clearly and honestly explained all of my choices on units before helping me make a choice and installing my new AC unit and furnace. He was here the next morning before 8 and worked all day to get me up and running so that by the time I got home from work that evening I finally had cold air blowing again. When he had to take down some existing shelves in my garage to fit the new (proper) unit configuration, he even carefully reshaped and rebuilt them after he was finished AND replaced all of my paint cans and tools on them exactly as they had been, which is above and beyond the call of any HVAC contractor I've worked with in the past. He also fixed a ton of poor ancient wiring and jerry-rigged electrical systems in the process, and he checked with me multiple times to make sure I was completely satisfied before calling the job finished and asking for even a single cent.\n\nI have been so pleased with every aspect of working with Court and Cool Breeze. His team has always been punctual, professional, and very honest about what did and did not need to be fixed, and I'm typing this review from the comfort of a very chilly house thanks to the AC he's had up and running for me since June. :) I would wholeheartedly recommend Cool Breeze to anyone who needs HVAC assistance."

Court gave us several options to consider after evaluating our HVAC needs based on the size and location of our house at Lake Martin.  We chose the highest efficiency unit because of the mfg reputation, long term warranty on both the unit and repair cost and his familiarity with other comparable products.  Court made 1 trip to assess specific structural and ducting needs at our location and then returned at the agreed upon date and installed the unit.  This was a time consuming effort and they stayed over 12 hours to make sure we would have air that night. He also left our basement cleaner then it was.  Since then we have also had Cool Breeze install a dehumidifier.  There was 1 minor problem that required replacement of the interactive thermostat which was quickly addressed.  We will definitely continue to recommend them and use them for all our HVAC needs!!!"

One company gave me a price and told me I had to sign that day for that price, and another told me they would need to rip out my ducts and drain pipes.\n\nMy third estimate was from Court and the Cool Breeze team and what a difference!  Court took the time to look at my old system, explained what SEER was and all my options including financing.  They answered all our questions and went over the controls a second time before they left.  They were careful not to track in the house and they cleaned up when they were finished.  They were professional in their work, demeanor and appearance and on a scale of 1 to 10 they were an 11."

I Inquired stating I needed a quote for a part on the furnace. Customer service lady Danielle said she would add that to the notes for when they came out. (Never said anything about a charge) 2 guys came out and then talking with Perry, said even just to come out is $129 without doing any work. Lol lesson learned."

Their regular maintenance has kept my system running, and when a 20-year-old system that came with the house died, they installed a quality system.  Today they're blowing new insulation in the attic since the original insulation has deteriorated.\n\nI appreciate their communication system - phone calls and texts - to stay in touch.\n\nThanks, Aire Serve!"

They performed with a Top Tier professional work ethic making sure that I was satisfied on every level.

What they don\u2019t tell you: automatic $475 fee for tech to open hvac panel even if they don\u2019t do anything. Plus a $231 shop vac fee for using vac to suck up a bit of water in drain pan. There were no repairs yet we pay $706 - total ripoff and company designed to trick you by withholding outrageous fees."

Thanks to his questions and willingness to investigate some things that did not make sense, he was able to locate loose ductwork in a very inaccessible area of my crawl space that would never have been found otherwise.

Out of all the companies I called for emergency service, they were the only ones who could come out the next morning. Amazing customer service! Our technician, John Rowland, was honest and knowledgable. He quickly fixed our AC and didn't try to upsell anything. We actually signed up for a yearly plan with them because we were so impressed and got a discount by doing that. Love that they personally call you with a reminder to schedule your furnace and AC yearly service. Furnace technician came out right on time and was great also. So glad to have found them!"

Though we didn\u2019t replace it, he was surprised it was only 2 years old and failed to connect to internet! He and the young man with him were very thorough and spent a fair amount of time inspecting our units! We\u2019re so glad we switched companies!"

In the meantime my unit went totally down and I called them back to have the unit replaced and was put out another week for the install.  Called several services but used Air Experts and am very pleased.  With 2 hours of my call they came out provided a quote after a thorough discussion.  Within 24 hours of my original call on a Monday morning my replacement unit was installed.  We could not be more pleased with the timeliness and professionalism."

They came the next day and worked until long after dark and after hours because they didn\u2019t want to displace us or leave us without heat because of our new baby. We were so touched that they worked so hard to do that for our family. They did great quality work for a reasonable price, we\u2019re so professional and timely.

I had them come back out this year cause I was having issues after I just spent 1,500 with them last year. This service was horrible they didn't fix it, charged over 200 dollars. Then gave me quotes for 3500 and 7000 and said my unit was done I needed a new one. I sweated it out for a few and got a second option, the other company came out and fixed it for under 200 and gave amazing service. I called this company back and was trying to explain how I felt taken advantage of and the office manager was rude he kept trying to tell me he didn't think his tech would do that but I watched the new company I had come out rewire it and it started working. Long story short don't use them, they'll over charge you and lie to you. Try Service Tech inc. they are amazing and service is the best!"

Keely and her folks represent our company better than any of the others that we work with.  Today I was called by a new client who stated that Holland's tech found things that the previous THREE companies missed.  And in doing so, actually suggested that they didnt need a new system, but improved insulation because the current system is large enough.  Let me rephrase that, the tech DID NOT sell them what they were asking for, and what was approved by the budget department of this large property management firm, and in doing so, saved them approximately $4000.  THAT IS SERVICE.  This company manages thousands of properties in the metro area, Holland didn't even know that fact.  Guess who is getting the call first the next time??"

The lady that I spoke to was very caring and easy to speak to.  She was attempting to send a technician out Saturday night, but I told her it was o.k. to setup the appointment for Sunday morning due to bad weather in the area.  She contacted me early Sunday to let me know that the technician was on the way to my home.  They also have an automated texting system that notified my cell when the technician was on the way.  The technician Billy arrived quickly and started to diagnose the issue with the outside air condenser after I told him the symptoms.  Billy was a great guy to work with and was very knowledgeable.  Billy told me that I defiantly had a bad capacitor and possibly a compressor.  I pretty much knew the capacitor was bad before he even arrived onsite.  Due to having a 13-year-old odd name 5-ton system Billy didn\u2019t have the right capacitor on the truck.  He asked me how bad I wanted it fixed on Sunday due to the warehouse being closed and it would cost a small fee to open.  I told him that I was hot and willing to pay the small fee.  Billy left the house and came back about an hour later to repair the unit.  When Billy pulled up I stopped him from repairing the unit.  I told him since it was a 13-year-old system, and I have had issues in the past that I was ready to replace.  I didn\u2019t feel any pressure from Billy attempting to sale me a new system.  He was ready for the less expensive repair.  Billy called home office and setup an appointment to replace the system on Monday morning.  The crew showed up Monday morning ready to work.  Everyone felt welcoming and treated my home like it was theirs.  I was very excited for the cold air Monday night.  I appreciate everyone at HACS that helped my family during this time of discomfort."

I called them on a Saturday morning because my air conditioner had stopped working, and they were able to send someone out to fix it within a few hours. The technician, Chris, was knowledgeable and courteous, and he diagnosed the problem quickly. He explained the issue and the repair options in a way that was easy to understand. The repair was done efficiently and effectively, and the price was very reasonable. I would highly recommend Nicks Heating and Cooling to anyone in need of HVAC services in the Birmingham area!"

We were initially impressed with the promptness of service and previously recommended this business. Update: Unfortunately, we are unable to schedule the repair service after paying $600.00 for line leak detection. We cannot get a return call to schedule service, and today, no one answers the phone, but I did leave another message. We've been waiting several weeks so far... Our water leak continues. If we continue to be unable to contact anyone to schedule service, we will have to look for another plumbing service. As it turned out the $600.00 leak detection service failed and we paid another firm to do our repairs. The rate was 75% less than what these guys quoted."

Since it\u2019s installation, I have had workers out 8 times to fix multiple issues, each blamed on shortcuts or problems with the original installation. This weekend the heat completely quit working. I had to call 7-8 times per day to get workers out to my house. Each time was told they could not fix it & I would just have to wait until Monday. I was left without heat in 28 degree weather for 3 days and forced to miss my Christmas vacation while I sit and wait for a worker to show up for over 3 hours.

        "text": "I have been a customer of Freedom Heating & Cooling for four years. They do semi-annual inspections of my systems, including cleaning and maintenance. During the four years they have also redone the duct work for my system and replaced the A/C unit and the furnace. I have rarely had the same technician two times in a row. I don't know\nJesse did my fall maintenance today and he did a thorough job. He explained things and answered my questions. I highly recommend him.\n\nwhy that is, whether they have a lot of turnover or if they have so many techs the same ones rarely return to a given site. I have recently been especially pleased with the service of D.J. My latest technician, Cedric Carter, did exceptional work. He was congenial, efficient, and returned everything to its proper place. I hope he comes again.\n\nToday, November 30, 2024, Kashun came to check my system for the heat fan not working. He quickly discovered a blown fuse on the system, replaced it, and got the fan running again. Took less than 20 minutes, but made a huge difference for the comfort of our house.\n\nRegarding the previous post on November 30, 2024, the fan ran less than 2 hours before going off again. I called Freedom repeatedly throughout the day Sunday when there announcement says their hours are 8-5. I never even got the courtesy of a call. Finally, Monday morning Kashun returned with Justin and they determined the system needed a new control board, which they installed. They said I would have \"regular\" heat overnight and they would be back Monday morning. Monday at 10:00, Michael Swann arrived. He spent 2 hours and found that the problem was occurring in the \"plug\" when the heat pump attempted to turn on the gas supplemental heat. I'm not sure what he did, but he assured me he had turned that switch on and off multiple times and it worked. He told me to monitor the system overnight to be sure the fan was turning on and off. It is now 2 days later and the system is working as expected. Thank you, Michael! Shame on Freedom for lack of communication and response on the weekend."

        "text": "I reached out to Freedom when my HVAC unit (which they installed for the previous homeowner) began to decline over Labor Day weekend. Of course, I was quoted that I needed to install a \"brand new\" unit to the tune of $14K that I am currently financing through their recommended service, although other companies I quoted afterward were not nearly this much. Install happened, and things were fine for about a week before I began noticing pooling water in my air intake and water damage on my bedroom and closet ceiling. The same guys who initially installed the unit came to fix the leak, and mentioned that someone would contact me about the water damage (which no one ever did).\n\nCut to this past weekend when I went to turn on the heat for the very first time on this brand new unit, and nothing is working. Air isn't heating and the unit won't kick off on \"auto.\" I had an appointment scheduled from 10-12, and the technician (really nice guy, all things considered) finally showed up at approximately 4 p.m. After working around on the outside unit, attic unit, and thermostat, I was essentially told he didn't know why it wasn't heating or why things were set up the way they were, and that they'd need to order a part to see if that would fix it. I was given no timeline of when that part would come in other than \"sometime next week,\" even though we're sitting here with 20 degree nights happening. I've called twice today to try and get some clarity, but keep getting sent to voicemail. Frustrated doesn't even begin to describe this experience."

They finished the job and contacted me to let me know they had completed the work.

        "text": "We got this HVAC unit installed in 2019. It has given us problems since the beginning of time. We spent several grands on labor without solution. Each technician blamed the previous one but the problems were persistent. Chris Horton felt different. Instead of pointing fingers, he went to work and found a few minor leaks in the evaporator coil that others failed to find and replaced parts in the outside unit. Two weeks later Daniel and Jonathan arrived on time and replaced the evaporator coil up to my satisfaction and got the system up and running without leaking any gas. I was at a point when I was having doubts believing HVAC technicians, Chris sounded very authentic and logical. Hoping I made the right choice by hiring Skyward."

I told him to send me info on someone who does and he never did.  It was almost a nuisance for him to come on the call.  Very bad customer service.

A representative (Chris) arrived early the next morning, and with a smile no less! He was very knowledgeable about various products, professional (masked and wearing shoe covers), patient and caring about our situation. He assured me that Stability Mechanical would exhaust every option to assist us, and that's just what they did! Not only did he and \"Kam\" (in office rep) work hard together to get us financed, but the actual owner briefly joined them on the phone and encouraged them to work with our budget to at least get the \"heat\" working. It was then, that I knew we had the best of Birmingham! But, that was not all. They were able to get us financed for and entire new HVAC Unit within our budget!\n\nDaniel and Drew were both very pleasant and very knowledgeable, as they answered every question I had. Together they installed a new HVAC unit in our home on Friday. Based on my experience with Stability Mechanical, the above ratings are accurate!  Thank you (Chris, Kam, Daniel, Drew, Turk and of course Joe)."

        "text": "We have home warranty through American Home Shield. Of course they sent Myers, (which we've never had a good experience with Myers)  to inform us we needed a new coil and some freon. We knew our coil was covered and then the freon that was not covered by AHS was estimated about $125. AHS called us, Myers sent in we also needed to have a total duct work adjustment which was $890 not covered by warranty. Myers never told us about needing a complete duct work adjustment.\n\nI call Stability Mechanical\u200b after hearing great reviews for a second opinion. Next day they were here and gave us a free inspection. Yes, we needed the coil and freon, but not a total duct work adjustment. They were back in two days and had the air fixed quickly. I will add, they were able to fix the air that day, but I needed to file a form with AHS to get a very little partial reimbursed.\n\nWe have not had one problems with the air since then. What we were going to be out of pocket having what home warranty did not cover was the same amount we paid Stability Mechanical. This was a realization to us  paying $60 a month for AHS warranty and a $75 service fee was a rip off.\n\nJoe, the owner of Stability Mechanical could not have been nicer, as well as his employees. We are not from this area, so it was so GREAT to find a company that was honest in telling us what exactly we needed, and not adding things we didn't need. I will never use another company for our AC/Heat issues."

The guys from Stability came out promptly and evaluated the situation. They explained why I needed a new unit. They also explained why it made more financial sense to go ahead and replace the unit. They could have suggested putting a band aid on it for a temporary fix only to have to ultimately replace it. And that might have worked--maybe even a few times. And it would have been profitable for them to \"fix\" it a few times before replacing the unit. However, these guys are honest and ethical. If you don't need it, it will not be suggested. I was able to get a nicer unit than what I had for a reasonable price that is far more energy efficient than what I had. It was also nice to do business with a local company. When you call, you get to speak to an actual person. The Stability guys will show up on time and get the job done promptly. They are polite and courteous as well. I would recommend them to anyone!"

He was never sales-aggressive with the ideas that we were given.

Giving up and calling other companies who will actually come out without making us wait hours or days to resolve the issue.\nEdit to add---two weeks later, same issue so obviously the problem was not solved. Last time, nothing was done but we were still charged. Today--who knows, but I am not holding hope that anything will be fixed.\n\nNot sure why we are paying for the $240 maintenance plan. Had the heating maintenance \"done\" earlier in the Fall and now, the first time we actually need the heat to work, it failed. AND instead of recognizing that since we paid a lot of money up front to ensure this would not happen that MAYBE they should waive the $110 service fee to show up at 7pm---NO, they made us wait and sleep with no heat and have our house be 50 degrees before sending someone and graciously then agreeing to waive the $50 service fee for showing up almost 24 hours later. Let's hope they can actually fix the issue they missed when rushing through the maintenance inspection AND do not try to take all our money after robbing us for the \"membership\".  Looking for another future option moving forward because this whole experience with them has been a joke."

I booked an online service appointment after turning off the unit and cleaning up the mess.  Keon came out the next morning, found the problem, and fixed it.  He showed me how to prevent drain clogs going forward.  Knowledge is power, y'all.  lol\n\nI was very pleased with my One Hour experience.  From discovery to resolution was only about 12 hours.  I was very lucky to have been able to book that early appointment online."

        "text": "10/11/2024., Well it happened again. A 20 yr old house and a 13 yr old AC unit meant that it was time to call our friends at One Hour AC. James is like an Old friend now that he has been out to our home a couple times or so. He is ALWAYS the same; Honest,\nProfessional, and straight to work. The damage wasn't too bad this time, but the service as always was great! Thanks AGAIN James...\"Roll Tide!!\"\n\n6/7/24. I had to update my last review. Flash forward 3 months and our worse fears came to pass. FURNACE REPLACEMENT. We are so GLAD to have One Hour Air.\nIt took a total of 2 very AWESOME technicians, (Pat & Sedrick) one day to come out and replace our 20yr old furnace, (in about 2hrs).\nThey were quick and very thorough. The day before, another one of your technicians, (Chad) had come out to check on us after replacing a thermostat and checking our unit for another issue. He was the one that provided us with pricing and upgrade options that made it easy for us to get the replacement unit. What really impressed me about Chad is that he did not \"Sugar-coat\" anything and was honest with me throughout and explained the problem with great detail and patience. (No pressure selling, fair recommendations regarding all of our financial options), GOOD GUY!\nThanks Chad we would still be sweating if not for your honesty and professionalism. Another example of why we will continue to use ALL of your services.\n\nPrior to this we had visits from \"James\" and \"James\" from Mr. Sparky who discovered an electrical issue with our AC, (Did I mention 20yr old house?), and then James from One Hour arrived after a call from James with Mr. Sparky and knew EXACTLY what needed to be done to complete our AC unit repair.  As a homeowner,  we love and appreciate the communication and team work between your companies. Thank you ALL for your  hardwork and Professionalism."

I called and set up an appointment for Sunday between 8-12 am. I got a call from my technician, Aaron, when he was en route and he arrived right at 9:00. He was gracious enough to walk me through the process and explain everything while answering mine and my husbands questions. From his expertise and professional attitude, we decided to cancel our current membership with another heating and cooling company and transfer it to One Hour. If you\u2019re looking for professionals in heating and air conditioning, I highly recommend One Hour- ask for Aaron Anderson. You won\u2019t be disappointed."

To my relief it turned out to be a simple (and rather silly) problem. Not only did he have it fixed quickly but he was extremely informative and educated me on what to be on the look out for in the coming years. So impressed was I that I signed up for their comfort club to have them come out twice a year and check on things for me. Worth every penny."

He was very knowledgeable and was able to diagnose and fix the problem very quickly. He was very helpful in helping understand what the issue was and some preventative measures we can do moving forward to help extend the life of our unit.

I texted JC's Heating and Cooling, expecting I would hear back from them on Monday, but Chad responded almost immediately and come over Saturday morning.  He took the time to explain what was happening and walked me through the process of getting a new furnace installed.\nI can not imagine what I would have done if I had not been a client of JC's for the past 7 years.  They have serviced my HVAC system since we moved here, so they know the condition of the unit.\nThey had a new unit installed by Wednesday.  They showed up on time and were done by noon.\nI'm so grateful to have such a fine group of gentlemen to rely on, when I needed help, quick. I trust them, and know they would not sell me something I don't need.  Thank you guys so much!"

After checking outside I went throught the house checking appliances making sure everything was working. The upstairs AC had stopped cooling and would not come on. I called JC's Heating and Cooling and left a message for a service call.  They called me back the first thing Friday said they would be here before noon. Upon arrival their technician checked all of the equipment both inside and out. Within 20 minutes the diagnosis was made that a power surge had knocked out the main motor in the air handling system. On Monday they were back with a new motor and the system was back cooling the house. A welcome relief since the heat outside is in the 90s and the humidity is almost 60%.\nThanks JC's!"

        "text": "I called this company to come out behind another installer and look at my system because it was only in for 3 weeks and started messing up. System was installed by someone I know from out of town and didn\u2019t have time to get back to look at it. They came and looked at it, spent all of 5-10 minutes, charged me $149 and then it felt like I was being ghosted. Couldn\u2019t get a response until a had called about 10 times in one day and even then they had no resolution to the problem. I got my friend to get the replacement part but I still needed someone to put it on and JC\u2019s told me I needed to find someone else. So basically they knew the situation before they ever came out and came out just to take my money and dip. They said that fixing the problem behind someone else was a liability, but if that was the case, they would only be able to fix units that they install and that\u2019s something that they knew up front which only reinforces the fact that they only came out to take my money in the first place."

We priced around and they were the least expensive, plus they reworked our ducts because they were not done where it was most efficient by the builder. (That was not included with the other quotes!) Yesterday the unit stopped working. A small part went bad and JC\u2019s came today, replaced the part and they are handling the warranty so that they can get reimbursed for it. All we had to pay today, was a small labor fee.\nWe highly recommend JC\u2019s Heating and Cooling!\nOne last thing, all of the gentlemen that we have met that work for JC\u2019s are professional and courteous! It is rare to find that these days!\n\nThey had to come back out today.....in 2021. They came on time, the young man was courteous and the amount paid was reasonable. They changed out a line outside, then emptied a pan upstairs that was overfilled. They also put a small amount of Freon in since it was a little low. We will stick with JC\u2019s!!"

My unit needed to be cleaned, serviced and possibly have coolant added but they weren\u2019t able to do it on that visit because the unit had frozen up.  I did as he instructed to de-thaw it and it started working.  Not as well, longer running tirmes than normal and not keeping the house as cool.  I have called 4 times since to set up an appointment for complete servicing and to enroll in a maintenance program with them.  I was patient because I know this is their busy season.  I left 3 voice mails and spoke to, I believe, the owner who was supposed to call me back, which he never did.\nMy unit is old and in an awkward place so maybe they didn\u2019t want the hassle. Or it could be their business is so good,  they didn\u2019t need mine.  But the professional thing to have done is to explain that they couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t want my business.\nI had heard good things about them on Facebook (which I\u2019ll correct now every time I see a post about them) and they were so nice and prompt the first time I called, that I was very disappointed in how they actually conduct business.  I was trying to stay local with an Irondale business, but in this case it wasn\u2019t worth it."

JC's is a small, family owned company with employees who have been with them ever since I started using them.  Chris, Chad and Wes are responsive, honest, reliable...and really likable!  I have a service contract with them, which means for a very reasonable price, they come out in the Fall and the Spring, change the filters, and make sure everything is running properly.  And every time we've had an outage, they've been right there for us.  I trust them to tell me when something can be fixed, or when something needs to be replaced. I recommend them highly."

        "text": "We have been displeased with this company. After spending well above what we have found to be the average cost of new AC units, our less than two year old unit recently went out. Three different technicians had to come out over the span of a week before the correct problem was found. We had to pay service fees for all of these visits even though none of them fixed the problem more than 24 hours. Finally, the last time we were told the control panel (which should be a part that lasts minimum ten years on a new unit) is broken and needs replaced, and it will cost $450 in labor fees. After contacting the manager to ask for some of our other service fees to be applied to this since the  problem was not found or solved the first three times we paid them, they said they would get back in touch with us. No one ever called back and we had to pay the full $450 for labor after already paying $200 for \u201cfixes\u201d that did not work."

He was able explain the units they have in terms that even I understood. The unit we originally agreed on, turns out was stuck in TN due to winter weather there and wouldn't be here in Bham until 22Jan24 so I could either wait it out, or, there was a similar unit that could be installed on 18Jan. I opted for the similar unit.\nThe real heroes were my installers, David McKinney and Keith Walton. They also were friendly, professional, and knowledgeable, willing to answer any questions I had. They were able to work through a few obstacles that were thrown their way, such as not being given all the details of the installation, and having to devise a way to get the unit into my backyard without a forklift to hoist it over the fence (there is limited width even with the fence door taken off).  They were problem solvers, cleaned up the work area in my backyard perfectly, and I had heat by that afternoon. So far, an excellent start for my customer experience with Norrell.\n\nUpdate: Anthony came and performed yearly maintenance today 11 Dec 24 and was thorough,  efficient, and polite. Definitely recommend."

I bought a new furnace, water heater and ductwork from the to solve the problem, yet I cannot get a call back or my money back for the \"diagnosis\"\n\nI complained about the diagnosis from the company and not getting a refund when the money was not returned.  I spoke too soon.  They fulfilled everything they said they would do and then some.  A check is to be mailed for the original fee.  They not only did was was quoted but found vent in the attic not connected omitting \"co\" (carbon monoxide\" into the attic.  They made the repair and we are very happy with Standard, have used them in the past and will do so again.  It great to do business with a company like Standard"

After going through 3 other companies to no avail over 3 months of chasing issues, we decided to call around and wipe the slate clean with a new system plus the addition of a Halo 6 whole home filtration system to stop the Alabaster lime, the calcium and removal of all chlorine from the water.\n\nStandard was the only company to call me back after calling countless others once we realized we were not going to get hot water again out of the old unit. Mike was our Technician and was simply fantastic. He made the case for what we now have from them and we went all in on it and couldn\u2019t be happier. He was top notch and knows his stuff. Standard even rearranged some things to get me up and going sooner than anticipated. Best money I could have spent. All around great experience from those who answer the phones all the way to Mike!\n\nI was a week away from divorce with no hot water, so you guys solved issues you didn\u2019t even know about. Ha!\n\nGreat job! 5 Stars!"

Special thanks to Brady, who discovered a problem we were unaware of and brought it to our attention. Brian, as always, was easy to work with, and Nick organized his team to do the installation. We are grateful that we were able to have heat every night as temperatures dropped in the twenties. The work looks great."

The technician, Austin Weems, arrived promptly, was very professional, and took the time to explain the importance of changing the air filter.\n\nNot only did Austin replace the filter efficiently, but he also conducted a thorough inspection of the entire system, ensuring everything was running smoothly. The difference in air quality was noticeable immediately!\n\nI appreciate Austin attention to detail and commitment to customer satisfaction. My home feels so much more comfortable now, and I can breathe easier knowing my AC is in top shape. I highly recommend their service to anyone looking to keep their air conditioning system running efficiently!"

A few minutes later, much to my surprise, I got a call from a tech who turned out to be Landon. He was patient and had me go through some steps to try and isolate the problem. I got a call from dispatch shortly after 7 AM  the next day and we scheduled a tech to come out between 8 and 8:30. At 8 sharp the tech arrived and it was Landon who I had talked to the night before. My wife is in a wheelchair and has Parkinson's so it was very important to us to restore service. After 1-1/2 hours, Landon identified the problem and made the necessary repairs!\n\nI am totally blown away specifically by Landon in particular and Standard in general by the quality of service and quick responsiveness in this case.\n\nBlessings,\n\nGeorge Gaskin"

Also, they said they need a jetter(heavy duty equipment), but their price was double($1400) the 2 other plumbing companies I got quotes from to bring a jetter out. I got charged $400, and they couldn't fix drain. They did try for 50 minutes, but it would have been nice to get a quote beforehand. This is standard procedure for most plumbers now."

So I called Ethridge and they came out asap meanwhile I had to take my pets and myself to a hotel.(more money!) the service tech called me and he was on his way.  I became very sick and Paramedics came to my home.  Meanwhile DARRYL.arrived.  He immediately took my keys to my home and went about doing his job saying he would take care of the situation.  The medics walked me to my next door neighbor to get me cooled down.  While I waited about 30 to 45 minutes. DARRYL came over saying it was up and running just fine after he found a bad fuse and some wiring replaced because it was bare.  He explained every thing beautifully and gave us some information about my AC all the while SO professional and asked me if I was feeling better.  He was a Godsend! And the charge was very reasonable!! I cannot stress enough Darryl was seriously a GODSEND!! I just want to tell everyone what a WONDERFUL job Darryl and Ethridge heating and cooling was! Highly Recommend recommend them.  They will now be my ONLY service company now.  Cudos Darryl you\u2019re awesome!!!"

        "text": "Technician arrived on time and correctly assessed that my air conditioner problem was a dead capacitor. After replacing it, he noticed that the air still wasn't cooling as well as it could have, so he checked the refrigerant level.\nThis is where things took a turn.\nTechnician told me that the system was low on refrigerant.\nOkay, let's add some.\nNo can do. Your system runs on R22, which is outlawed.\nIs there a replacement?\nYeah.\nWell let's put that in.\nI can't mix them.\nCan you flush the old refrigerant and replace it with the new?\nWell, that's $1500.\nSo what are you telling me?\nThere's nothing we can do. Your unit is old (2009) and at the end of its life. I can give you some estimates for new one.\nAfter this, the technician sat at my table at proposed three different options ranging from #$11,000 to $20,000 dollars for a 2.5 ton unit. When I expressed a desire to fix what I've already got, he tried to talk me out of it.\nYou must work on commission, I said.\nNo, it doesn't matter to me one way or the other, he said.\nIt didn't sit right with me, so I said I'd think about it and after the technician left, I called three other AC repair businesses who all refuted what the Ethridge technician told me.\nI had one of them come out and look at the unit for a second opinion. I was told that 1) my unit was just slightly low on coolant and not nearly as low as I'd been led to believe, and that 2) R22 substitute refrigerants are widely available and a unit can be filled for just a few hundred dollars. In fact, you can buy a 25 pound supply that will last many years for $400.\nFurthermore, the technician I called for a second opinion spent two hours looking for things that could be wrong with my unit and found nothing at all. I was told that the unit is performing as well as it can for a 15 year old system and that in this extreme heat (upper 90s) I shouldn't expect it to cool much better than it already is and that even his own home unit wasn't able to cool much better than mine during this time of year.\nThis review is a long time coming. I've been using Ethridge for years, and their technicians have been telling me my units are on their last legs for the better part of decade, but they're still trucking along. The unfortunate truth is, Ethridge technicians would rather lie about your AC problems to convince you to buy a new one (for a cool $20,000) than fix what you've already got.\nI wish it wasn't true, but the proof is in the pudding."

After a disappointing experience with another company, we decided get a second opinion, and gave Ethridge a chance.\n\nThe lady on the phone was very pleasant and arranged for a technician to inspect our system that same night.\n\nOur technician, Alex, stood out to us. He was incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to explain each step of the process, even inviting us to observe. Despite working the late night to ensure our AC was working, He took the time to talk with us, and we actually enjoyed the time he was there. We\u2019ve never had a more pleasant experience with someone working in our home.\n\nAlex's genuine demeanor and transparency was a refreshing change from past experiences. It was clear that he genuinely cared about our needs and wasn't looking to push unnecessary services. This was in stark contrast to the previous company that wanted us to replace something that didn't need replacing. As a result, we saved around two thousand dollars by choosing Ethridge.\n\nFeeling confident in our decision, we have already started recommending Ethridge to others. If you're seeking an honest AC company that puts your best interests first, especially for new homeowners, Ethridge is the way to go, and request Alex for exceptional service!"

I called and left a voicemail with basically an S.O.S. saying we were melting. I woke up in the morning to already having a voicemail left by them at 7:15 am. By 8:30 am, they were at my front door, and by 9:30 am, we had A/C running through the house again. Their prices were exceptionally reasonable and our master tech, Alex, did a wonderful job explaining the issues and why he was doing everything. He also gave some pointers on additional subjects, which was much appreciated. We went ahead and signed up for their yearly maintenance check-ups as the cost is exceptional and will help avoid issues down the road. I could not recommend them more!"

We\u2019re pleased to give the business to a Veteran owned company. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 The installation was today. Tyler and two associates were here promptly at the appointed time, and worked diligently through the day. They were polite and professional.

There are many benefits to the home owner if you do join and one of the benefits is the total home electrical inspection.  I was very impressed with Chad who showed up at our house on time.  I like to accompany the technician as they do their job.  I followed Chad, who is a veteran of the company and I was very impressed.  I always ask questions about the inspection and what he is looking for etc.  I do so not because I want to make sure they do their job but to learn about the systems. I ask questions and most technicians are  comfortable giving me answers.  In this case Chad was very knowledgeable and he easily answered my questions and even explained why he was looking.  Once again, I cannot emphasize enough how good this company is."

Quickly, ended up meaning that another employee went to the warehouse and picked up the necessary part and brought it to him while still on the job site.

I believe they did not install the right size unit for the house. It was installed improperly to begin with - thankfully they fixed the issues after requesting them to come back.\nBut now I have a unit that doesn't work effectively and I'm 10k out.\n\nThe technicians who come to clean the unit don't sound like they actually know what they are talking about about either.\nMy unit stopped working and they said it was from ants or some bugs eating it from lack of maintenance- it has been 1 year since it was maintained. I have family members who never get their units cleaned and I skipped it for less than a year and they say that's why I need to spend hundreds of $$$ ???... Just saying it's fishy. And I mentioned - this unit is less than 3 years old.\n\nI have used Excalibur for multiple services including electrical repair and HVAC issues of all kinds. Excalibur has always provided exceptional service and I always feel well taken care of. They always help me get the best value or deal that works best for me. Integrity is very important to me when it comes to home maintenance and Excalibur has integrity."

From the start, Roy called and said he would be here in 25 minutes.  25 minutes on the dot, he was out front.  He asked if I preferred he park on the street or in my driveway.  I\u2019ve never had anyone ask me that.  So much attention to EVERY detail.  They were nicely dressed and used shoe covers.\n\nI bought a smart switch and needed help getting it working right.  Roy tried and tried to get it to work.  I told him I didn\u2019t have to have the dimmer function if that would help.  He was insistent on getting the switch fully working right.  The fact that I have 14/2 wiring in my house complicated things.  My switch required 14/3 wiring.  He even offered to stay past 5pm and rewire the switch if I wanted that.\n\nI\u2019ve never been as happy after a service tech left as I was today.  I truly enjoyed them and appreciate all they did for me!!\n\nI highly recommend Excalibur!"

        "text": "I had a plumbing emergency! 2 toilets in the house and neither was working. I called in Friday evening, hoping to have someone come out then or even in the morning.\nScheduled for first thing Saturday morning. I was told they'd call when they were on the way.\nAt 1:15 pm yesterday and I hadn't heard from anyone.\nCalled the office and apparently the girl I originally spoke with, hadn't scheduled me. I'm sure it was simply accidental. They were then going to call the techs and I should have been seeing them soon.\n2 hours later, still no contact, nothing. I called the office, again. This is when it started to change. The lady I spoke with, Tonya, now knew the entire situation and was going to get this fixed.\nShe called me back and let me know the technician was finishing one, I'd just been added to his schedule and would be on the way.\nBenjamin White was who showed up and I'm incredibly thankful. His kindness and his positive attitude almost made me forget I'd been waiting all day. He had never been given the order. He got it at 4 in the afternoon. The office staffed dropped the ball, not the technician. He came in, accessed the situation, explained it to me, fixed it, and even discounted my price because of the day's events. It's unusual to have GREAT customer experience these days, as sad as that is, but HE was great. Again, kindness, understanding, positivity. If someone had come in with a terrible attitude, after waiting all day, this review would be much different!!\nYesterday, to me, ended up much different than i expected and it is all because of my technician. I'd like to think they're all this way! I will always request him, if I need further work. Also, you should make sure to request him. The first 2 employees i spoke with, majorly dropped the ball, but Tonya and Benjamin ran it back home for the win! \ud83d\ude0a"

        "text": "My husband and I returned from a trip to find a very expensive water bill and what ended up being a leak from our waterline. It seems we have made a mistake with calling Xcalibur. While the workers were polite and friendly the pricing was outrageous.\n\nThey quoted us at $7,000 to put in a new water line!! Even we knew that was an outlandish price. My husband refused and asked for $5,500 since we knew a friend had one done for $3,850 with CJ plumbing and another family friend had one done for $4,300. They would not be competitive and get within 1.5k of another local company (they came down to $6,300). The managers response: \u201cWe are not the cheapest option.\u201d We weren\u2019t asking for that, but we were asking for them to be competitive. Sadly, they aren\u2019t even that.\n\nUpon further review of the project, they did a poor job with cleanup/aesthetics. The water line may be quality work but their follow through of presentation and cleaning isn\u2019t. Picture and video show how much they destroyed our yard and left mud, broken bricks and small trench in our mulch bed. The last picture is of our friend\u2019s yard after he paid $2,450 less with CJ plumbing to have his done (same issue- waterline leak, new line replacement). Which looks better? Which price would you rather pay? Call someone else, save money and have a better-looking yard & mulch bed.\n\nADDITIONALLY: I would be highly skeptical of the owners\u2019 responses to negative reviews here.  He responded to my husband\u2019s saying he would call him on Monday. Not only did he not call on the following Monday, but my husband left a message for him on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Still no returned call."

        "text": "The employees were polite, respectful and the work so far seems to be satisfactory. Unfortunately, their price is outrageous.\n\nTo directly quote the manager I spoke with: \u201cwe are not the cheapest option.\u201d I was not expecting them to be the cheapest, but I was expecting them to be competitive \u2013 sadly they were not even that. If their pricing was competitive, I would have given 4 or 5 stars. Their commercials harp on quality and how important quality work is. I am all for that and here for it! However, what they don\u2019t say is that they clearly believe you must sacrifice affordability for quality. And that is simply not true. I gave them a try because the owner was a former Marine, and my dad was an officer for 27 years with the Corps. I really wanted to like them but will not be using them again and will be telling neighbors and friends to steer clear as well.\n\nTo give you specifics, they initially quoted me at OVER 7k to put a water line in. I refused that and they came down to $6,300. A friend of mine got the same exact thing done with CJ plumbing in Birmingham for just $3,850 (I can prove with receipt and pictures). Another family friend had theirs done for $4,300 with a different company. I have used Eagle Plumbing and On Time service in the past and their work has been quality AND affordable, I will be returning to them (and trying CJ\u2019s) for my plumbing, electrical, & AC needs. Don\u2019t waste your time with this company or you will drastically overpay. I should have just gone an extra day without water and called a different company to come out and saved significant money. Don\u2019t make the mistake I made.\n\nREPLY TO OWNER BELOW:\nThe owner never called on Monday. I called on Tuesday and left a message for him which the secretary said she gave to him. Did not receive a call back on Tuesday.  Have now called again on Thursday and left another message."

Roy and \"An\" Showed up on time and provided us with a fair estimate to replace the bad circuit breakers on our electrical panel that kept tripping. Roy recommended surge protectors to protect the new and older circuit breakers so we elected to install two protectors on each panel for peace of mind.  and they came with a five year warranty.  These guys are true electrical professional and their electrical service charges are competitive with others. I highly recommend you give Excaliber services a chance to provide identical top class services that we received for your own electrical repairs."

Can\u2019t blame the company on that but we got a very dedicated technician that was dead set on installing the right way. There was a hiccup in the replacement coil due to the manufacturer of the coil not the technician. He never gave up trying to diagnose the problem until he found it. I now have working ac after almost 2 months. Very impressed with the quality of work and dedication that Mr. Issac had to getting me and my family back to comfortable temps. Highly recommend this company. Very satisfied. Not sure if his name is spelled correct but Issac is the guy that you want to get you ac running right."

At the end of the day we had hot water in our home again which was a great relief to myself, my wife and her children! I would highly recommend Excalibur services to others because of the experiences that I've had with you thus far. This is actually the second time that we've called on Excalibur and in both instances we've been very satisfied with the performance of your teams. Christopher was a very professional individual and I would welcome him. Again, thank you for getting us all squared away!"

They started work as soon as they unloaded and worked non stop.\nThey were very thorough with the service cleaning our vents, duct work and dryer vent. We are very pleased with Excalibur and the professionalism and work of these two men . Thank you Marcus ,Tyler and Excalibur. We will recommend you highly to our family, friends and neighbors. I remarked to my wife I could now breathe through my nose instead of my mouth. Wonderful !"

The eta of finish was 4 to 5 hours and they finished in half that time. The work area was left way better than they found it, me and my wife were very impressed at there quality of there work. There was a mud puddle around my old unit, and they built a drainage area around the unit with rocks and lumber. Overall very fine work indeed. Thank you xcalibur, Highly recommend to others."

The work on the first day showed the furnace is up to spec, but there was an air leak problem between the air ducts and coil section/exit of the air.\nAt first I thought I could fix it.  After close examination and finding major openings with loose tape (which easily pulled off) I determined this job needed more than I should do.\nToday Beau repaired all the leaks and then some.  I found another a major gap on the other end of the coil section.  Again, the tape easily came off\nOur furnace should not leak for years now."

From the very cordial and helpful Paradise employee who answered our after-hours, weekend phone call to the technical service provided by Jonathan and Matthew on Monday - we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. We were informed every step of the way via text of all pertinent information including: scheduled appointment time, tech arrival time with the id\u2019s of technicians who would be performing the work. Jonathan and Matthew arrived five minutes earlier than the one hour scheduled window (no no-shows here), did what they had to do and didn\u2019t use weaponry to determine labor costs.

What sets Paradise apart is Jonathan took the time to explain my current system, as well as pricing comparable new systems. Not once did he try and sale me the bells and whistles that did not align with what I was replacing like the other businesses. He was not pushy and his prices can't be beat. You can't go wrong with Paradise Heating and Air and they will be my shop for any HVAC needs moving forward. Thank You for being fair and honest."

Techs Jonathan and Matthew came out for the initial inspection and service and came back to do the attic insulation. They were patient and knowledgeable (I ask a lot of questions) and took their time. They found all the places that my system was leaking (out and in) air, fixed them, and then filled the attic. They kept the house clean and were respectful and had great attitudes the entire time. They have definitely earned my business, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for HVAC work.

Mr. Jonathan is a true American technical craftsman, he was quick to identify the problem and fix it in no time.  During this time, one of my neighboring Condo owner requested him to look at his AC unit as it wasn't cooling or working properly and Mr. Jonathan agreed to look at it and fixed it.  The price was more than reasonable for me and Mr. Jonathan told my neighbor that he will waive the service fee because they were already there to fix mine which saved him money and made him very happy.

I did call to talk with the person that booked the appointment with some questions about pricing and how they charge for the work they would be doing, and she answered all of my questions. They arrived on time, and very quickly identified the issues with the system. They had it repaired and back up and running in no time. They then spent a lot of time answering all of my questions and looking at additional issues I have. I never felt rushed, and they answered all of my questions in detail. They charged me the price they said they would, and the system is back up and running. I will definitely use them again."

We just bought our first house and are so nervous about trying to find someone honest to do repairs. We knew our house didn\u2019t have much insulation, but didn\u2019t realize that meant it was going to be very cold and drafty. Jonathan came out and spent at least an hour looking at our systems and explaining everything to us. He is very knowledgeable about how air moves through an house and said our heater was fine, it was the lack of insulation. They got us fixed up with new blown-in insulation and roof vents in less than a week, and the house was so much warmer and less drafty!  Everyone that works there is very nice and they are really good about communicating when they\u2019ll arrive and showing up on time.

That we are terrible at figuring out or fixing anything related to heating and air conditioning.  Since our trip simply made things worse, we decided to reach out to Paradise Heating & Air. Somehow, in only two days, they figured out everything that was wrong, gave us details, and then fixed the heating, electrical and insulation issues, and had the tenants warm again before the incredibly cold weather hit. The tenant called to thank me and my family for the amazing work, so we figured we should write a review since we received a thank you that belongs to Paradise Heating & Air.  :)"

The first thing I noticed about this company was the call back response. I scheduled online and it wasn't 10min before I received a call back. Loved!! Secondly, I received a text stating \"we'll be arriving in 30min\". They really showed up in 30min. Loved!! I met the owner Jonathan and his son Trent, both were super nice and very professional. Once I explained to Jonathan what was going on with my system, he put his expertise to work. He wasn't able to do what he needed due to a locking cap on my system. Once he got the key, he was able to do what he needed. While waiting for the tool he needed, Jennifer (OMG, she's super sweet) stayed in contact with me. Finally, Jonathan got me all squared away. The thing I most appreciate about Paradise is the passion that Jonathan has. He wasn't just telling me anything. He was very thorough and detailed. He wasn't trying to get me out of his hair and make a dollar, he was truly concerned about my issue. My sister was having issues with her a/c system and Jonathan went and took care of her. I would recommend Paradise to everyone I know who's having HVAC issues. I have made Paradise a part of my family. Thank you Paradise!!!"

        "text": "Paradise Heating and Air did a phenomenal job at our house and saved us tons of money. We had a few issues going on including excess dust, high humidity, and a major temp split between upstairs and downstairs due to being on a single system.\n\nJonathan was quick to come out for an assessment and quote. He provided multiple options to fit our needs and budget. There was no pressure from him when it came to us deciding on the right option. He simply educated us on what needed to be done and the pros and cons to each option.\n\nThe majority of the ductwork was removed including the trunks that were duct board. The trunks were replaced with 12\u201d metal duct and insulated. Two additional trunks of the same size were added. Two trunk lines are dedicated to the downstairs and the other two for the upstairs. Each trunk has an electronic damper that actuates more open or more closed as air is needed between the zones. A zone control board was installed to manage the dampers. An additional thermostat was installed for the upstairs portion of the house.\n\nSince this work has been done, we haven\u2019t seen any dust particles floating around the house like before. Our humidity levels went from being in the high 70\u2019s to the mid 40\u2019s. We have ran a dehumidifier constantly over the years that would need to be emptied multiple times a day. It\u2019s been over a week since this work was completed and we haven\u2019t had to empty the dehumidifier once!! The temperature split between floors is nonexistent. Simply set the upstairs to a temp and the downstairs to a temp and the system works flawlessly. Perfect for us having a nursery upstairs set at 70\u00b0 and our bedroom downstairs set at 68\u00b0.\n\nParadise Heating and Air is by far the best around. Great pricing, accurate assessments on what needs to be done, and scheduling is a breeze. Do yourself a favor and call them anytime you need anything HVAC related!!!! Thank you, Jonathan and the whole team at Paradise Heating and Air for everything y\u2019all did for us. It honestly feels like a completely new home to us."

During this cold snap my furnace died and we found a significant leak in my hot water heater. They were out in less than 2 hours. They stayed for hours making sure to get financing set up for me and again replaced it the same day working well into the evening so we didn\u2019t freeze overnight.

These guys who were wonderful, Chris, Jacob, and Noah worked thru the night to get us some cold air.  They didn't say, \"Oh tomorrow, we can install\".

Each young man was courteous to me and my husband explaining the cost as well as the service involved and extended warranty.\nFast forward a year, it is time for the annual inspection.  Tim was the technician sent to my home.  He was clean, courteous and very knowledgeable. From first putting on booties over his shoes to enter my house to inspection and explanation what service needed done, he was nothing but professional.\nPerfect Heating and Air far exceed any business in product availability, knowledgeable technicians, and outstanding customer service.

Our area was devastated by the storm. We had several trees down blocking not only our road and driveway but were in the way of the electric trucks coming in to restore power. His crew worked day and night to help us clear it. We also had no running water. His donation allowed us to have drinking water for several days. I could not be more grateful for his generosity.\nTHANK YOU JOEY IRWIN!!!"

He sent down a bunch of cases of water and we were all able to have water to drink for the 5+ days we did not have it. And thank you to your employees for helping clear our road and our yards from all of the trees that came down during the storm. We all would not have gotten as much done or had water without you guys!"

He noted several issues and called for Alan to come and verify what he had found. There were some major issues which were thoroughly explained to me. It was determined that in order to prevent any further problems and a very possible breakdown of the unit that it would be best to replace it. Alan went through our options and we decided to upgrade to a new unit. Alan even called his supervisor and we got the best unit available at a reduced price. We signed a contract and now the most amazing thing happened. Alan said the unit would be installed that night. It was about 10:30 that night when Skylar and Carter showed up with a new unit. They had the old unit removed and the new unit installed somewhere around 12:30 am. It was an amazing operation to watch and both of them are true professionals. In fact, everyone I have dealt with at Perfect Service have been professionals at the highest level. More work had to be done on Monday. Again, Skylar and Carter showed up to in stall the doghouse. Again, quality work. Also, Josh and Jacob showed up the same day to perform the duct cleaning. Again, professional and thorough work. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Perfect Service Heating and Air. Their people are courteous and friendly and certainly knowledgeable in all aspects of HV/AC.  You can\u2019t go wrong by calling them for your heating and air needs. I would highly recommend them to anyone and everyone. Thanks for all you did for me. So thanks, Joey, Alan, Skylar, Carter, Josh and Jacob. You all are number one in my book."

Told me I would need to replace the control panel & evaporator coil. Parts would take between 3-5 days to arrive since I had an older AC system. They tried to sell me a new unit but that isn't in my budget which I explained at the beginning of the sales pitch. I ended up having someone else come fix my AC. Funny (sarcasm) how Perfect Service said I needed a new control panel, however, they connected a wrong wire on the panel which caused it not to work. THEY ARE ONLY $$$ FOCUSED SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY WILL TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR SITUATION."

My dad's heat pump was recently replaced because the techs caught a problem that would have completely shut down his unit. Perfect Service was with us every step of the way making everything  effortless in a quick time frame. They made buying a replacement heat pump a breeze at a very reasonable price.\nI would like to give Brian and Brandon a special shout out. They are great guys. They were very professional, friendly and informative. Great job guys!\nYou can't go wrong with Perfect Service. I speak from 20 years of experience with them."

They came out to our house right away. Our technician, Bo Jordon, shared his expert knowledge and professionalism to help us choose the best repair and upgrade option. He installed two awesome wifi thermostats and whole house air purifiers for both air handling units. The price was very reasonable. What impressed me most was Bo's conscientiousness and knowledge. He immediately established our trust in this company. Afterward, we had a couple minor adjustments that were needed because of other preexisting problems; we called them and Bo came back out immediately to get everything sorted out. We're grateful to have found this HVAC company to service our equipment and recommend them to all in need of good HVAC service. Thank you!"

A long story - but ending was I could choose one of three different systems from $10,000-15,000 (one system said to be defective ), cash was King, \"just point to the price that you need (felt like a used car sale)-  I explained I would not be making a decisions that night- a couple of times and they left-  I called the company who installed the systems the very next morning- and they came out-  I covered the company name on the notes left for me (trying to be fair to Perfect Service) and let the Technician see what the issues were-  He really ignored the notes and did his own inspection- NOTHING was found wrong- showed me the \"defective area\" and it's built that way- not defective.  Checked for Freon leaks (turned units off/on etc)- nothing-  said he'd be happy to clean the outside units but they weren't very dirty- This company could have told me the same thing or even a smaller problem to be fixed (to incur extra fees/charges)-  there was NO problem with either unit-  NOTHING-  so from you need $15,000 worth of equipment/service to absolutely no issues?  I never heard back from Perfect Service - with the level of concern and possibility  of a large sell, you'd think they would have followed up- Again- super nice folks but I read other reviews that were similar, confirmed same sort of \"Sales job\" and even talked with another client locally who thinks the company might have intentionally created the issue they ended up paying $4,000 to fix-  I never (hardly ever) do reviews- and never a negative review- but this was such an amazing experience that it really needs to be part of their review and let other now so they can make their own decisions- I'd also note that I had cameras with audio recording so some of this can't be denied- *******UPDATE-  I have spoken with Landon and addressed the issues I had-  He has offered to refund the money paid for original scheduled service and listened/responded to my complaints.  I have some hope that being willing to discuss the issues might result in improvements-"

Jay and their team have worked on my system since they acquired KS Services a couple years ago and since they have been extremely difficult to even get over to the house to do work.  When they do come, all you hear about is how bad everything is and recommend things that don\u2019t make since.  They installed dampers for zones that don\u2019t work at all, installed ducts that don\u2019t need to be there and when I asked them to remove them they just taped up the hole they made and left the huge duct sitting in my cellar.  The worst part of their company (which is a tough thing to determine) is their attitude and customer service, though.  My board got zapped by a storm last Friday and was without AC over the weekend (this is early August, some of the hottest days of the year).  I tried calling them probably 8 times.  They have an answering service.  Every time I called the operator said they have been in touch with them, and that they would call me right back.  Of course, nothing.  The next Monday morning I start calling again and they would pickup the phone and then hang up.  Thought it was a mistake but I called multiple times and heard them pickup and then hang up.  Eventually I emailed Jay Douglas, and he said I should contact the salesman from the prior company to get it fixed.  What?  They don\u2019t exist and they bought the customer book (me).  What a coward.  Their work sucks.  Their attitude sucks.  And they will make you miserable if you become a customer.  Can\u2019t recommend that you run as fast as you can, like I am, away from this company."

        "text": "I would recommend Douglas Heating and Air to my mother.\n\nThe first thing to say is that my job wasn't easy. It required fitting a new system into older duct work, getting up to code, and off site fabrication of fitting pieces. Plus, I needed both heating and cooling. So, this job was not an easy one.\n\nWith all that said, Douglas exceeded my expectations. Scheduling began the job, and the guy I talked to worked with me to find a date that would work around my homeschool schedule and my wife's work - no easy arrangement in itself. Then, the sales rep arrived to look at my system. The arrangement was just to look at what was going on, and the salesman walked in took one glance at the situation, and said, \"So, we're replacing this, right?\" I had a ton of questions given such a quick response. The salesman with a patience that defies reason explained each section not up to code, the problems seen with the heating, and the failures of the cooling. Every detail was pointed out to me. That's a level of professionalism that I haven't encountered.\n\nAt long last the replacement job arrives, a two man crew arrived at my house. They, initially, went through the steps of seeing where the job was and getting access. Then, the lead guy took the time to explain to me what the plan was. For example, the air conditioner would happen at this point; the heater at that point, and you may expect this, that, and the other thing during the process. As a result, I could handle the kids with the loud noises. Even after they completed the work [no small feat as I said], they showed me the results of what they did. The lead took me to each connection, showed me the outcome of the off site fabrications, and explained to me how the new thermostat worked - gave me a complete tutorial.\n\nSo, if you're looking for someone to do the job with technical accuracy, you've found your crew. If you're looking for some value added as far as customer service and professionalism, then pick Douglas Heating & Air."

He was quickly able to identify that the ignitor was fine that I just needed some general/preventative maintenance done and my fireplace is now working.  Besides just fixing the problem, he took the time to explain to me what went wrong and he kept me informed on what he was doing the entire time.  I've got to say that he is one of the most friendly and professional technicians I have ever worked with from any company hands down.  I'm extremely satisfied with his help today and with Douglas Cooling and Heating as a whole.  Every company that works with the public needs to have several Jonathans!  Douglas Cooling and Heating will definitely have all my future business.  Thank you Jonathan for your superior work and thank you Douglas Cooling and Heating for exceeding my expectations!"

The Douglas representative came out and we talked through the options without any high-pressure sales pitches, and I received a quote with four different options the same day,  all of which were very competitive with quotes I had received from two other reputable companies.  The work was completed exactly as described on the schedule that was agreed to.  The technicians  who did the installation were competent, friendly and respectful.  I have found my new plumbing and HVAC guys in Bham and highly recommend them."

I was impressed by the exemplary diligence in SAFETY ( mask, electrical precautions) CLEANLINESS ( shoe covers, floor tidiness) EXPERTISE ( all apparent and stealthy  issues were assessed and diagnosed) and FOLLOW-UP (after intervention calls to make sure all was well). Overall, my experience was outstanding! Douglas Cooling Heating and Electrical is synonymous with integrity and excellence."

Very reasonably priced and they called me to let me know it was ready to pick up.  Basically, my review is,  Douglas does what they say they are going to with no suprises, which is rare these days.

We heartily recommend Douglas for all your HVAC needs!\n\nUpdate:  Had to call Douglas the next day; the outside unit was still having issues coming on.

Ricky and Russell installed dampers to cut the air flow to that room in order to keep the main area of the upstairs cool. They did a great job of not tracking a mess around my house since they had to work in my attic and were finished by mid morning. Again, very impressive.

Courteous, knowledgeable, and articulate...you don\u2019t find those qualities often in folks who work in this area, but we sure did with Richey.\n\nCan\u2019t say enough nice things about Douglas...we are very pleased with what they\u2019ve done for us!!"

Chad provided the following things that led to my decision: (1) He called me back the same day    (2) He came out when he said he would   (3) I didn\u2019t feel the pressure of him trying to upsell me something I didn\u2019t need   (4) He offered a great product for a fair and reasonable price. If you are in need of a new HVAC or your HVAC serviced, Chad is dependable and honest. I highly recommend him and will use him in the future as needs arise."

Doug and his employees did an excellent job, cleaned the unit to get it working again and installed a new filter box for us. The house is cool now and we are happy. Infinity went over and beyond. Doug even came out again the following day to show us how to install the new filters. Infinity provided great service, they came out quickly and they were the most responsive and reasonably priced company we have dealt with. 10 out of 10 !"

He did not make me feel that the unit must be replaced immediately.  I appreciated his attempts, but knew the unit was on its way out.  When the unit finally gave out again, I made the decision to replace the unit.  Infinity gave me an extremely reasonable and competitive quote.  They also offered excellent, manageable financing with a well known institution.\nThe unit replacement process was  completed in one day with little inconvenience to me.  The technicians were neat, efficient, professional & friendly.  After the unit was replaced I had a few questions, and the company owner was quick to come by my home and address the situation.  He left me with a feeling of confidence that he guaranteed their work and the system installed.\nInfinity Air Solutions gave my home cool air again, coming from a new, beautiful Trane unit along with the education of its operations.  (Yes, it was beautiful to me, after spending two weeks in this summer's 100 degree weather.)  They also left me with the feeling that they would be there if I had any future needs.  I will be calling them in the future for regular maintenance on my new unit.\nI highly recommend Infinity Air Solutions, Heating & Air Conditioning.\nJenny McCune\nBluff Park, Hoover, AL"

Pricing was middle of the road (some bids higher, some lower), but this outfit sent out a knowledgeable young man who answered our questions, and showed up when he said he would, to remove the old system and install the new one, which has worked flawlessly since. We moved here (thanks to my former employer) from California, so the climate change was rather spectacular, from an area with much dryer weather to the typical heat and humidity one finds in this part of the world. We do seem to be saving somewhat on power usage, but will not really know until a complete set of seasons has passed. All in all, dealing with Infinity Air was a good experience."

Not only did I get the sweetest lady that answered the phone but she told me that her technician would he at my home within the hour. That was music to my ears. It was already 88 inside the house. He (owner) was indeed here within the hour and turns out the unit only needed a smart part replaced. He replaced and our unit has been cooling since. The repair cost was very reasonable especially for a Sunday call. He did not jack the price. We were more than pleased from beginning to end. They are good people!!"

We new someone that actually works there but weve never had to deal with this before so it just made sense to call them. Im so glad we did! I have NEVER had any kind of technician show up that quick. Thank Jesus it wasnt a new unit but we didn't freeze! He fixed it, hung around for a min to make sure it was running properly, asked us if there was anything more they could do for us an it was done.

It took longer than expected as the filter unit that I had already purchased would not work with my ducts. He explained that it would be less expensive to get a different unit than custom duct work. He seemed very honest, knowledgeable, and definitely took pride in his work. Glad to be able to support a local family-owned business and neighbor. We are very pleased with the results."

I have not been around a specialist that was detailed, knowledgeable, and most of all, very informative of product selections and the entire HVAC system.

They were professional and informative. After greeting each other and showing them where everything was, the technician got right to work.\nThe technician inspected the unit, found the problem, explained the problem and solution to the wife and I, fixed the problem the same day and the unit is now working better than what it was before.\n\nI was so grateful we finally found a company that is honest and true to their word. After all was said and done, I told the technician that they now have a customer for life!\n\nThanks again Dawson True Heating & Cooling for your great service and hospitality."

I have my maintenance check ups, but have never had a service call for something going wrong. I called with one issue recently and spoke with Shaun after a storm came through. He told me exactly what to do to get my unit going  by checking circuit breakers . He saved me from having to spend money on service call just to have someone come and turn on breaker.\nThey are very professional and respectful of you and your property.\nI feel they have a certain ethic that is missing in a lot of companies."

I am a resident of Gardendale and Alatec Heating & Cooling called me back quickly even though it was on a Sunday.  Andrew, Sean, Mike, and the other technicians were very helpful, friendly, professional, and cleaned up after themselves once the job was complete.  My new unit is working great with a ten year warranty and I really appreciate how Sean emailed me copies of my warranty registration and original work invoice that same day the crew completed the job even though it was after 5:00 p.m.  I used Alatec Heating & Cooling to service my other unit last year and this company did a great job then.\nI used this company this year to replace my other unit and they did a great job.  I will definitely use them in the future when needed!!  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!"

We did not like the idea of a gas heat at all. Mike was able to get us a great deal on a new unit and the best part is that we now have all electric heat and air! The new unit looks and works great.\nUpdate 2023. Had a issue with our ac and Mike sent a tech out and was able to diagnose the problem and get it fixed for us. We had a bad coil that was under warranty so only had to pay labor. Super polite and professional tech named Cliff that went above and beyond to get our ac cooling at its peak performance. Would recommend anyone looking for a company they can trust to get the job done at a very fair rate to give Alatec a call."

Because it was raining, he to me they'd try to be out first thing Friday morning. Friday morning, they were here. They explained to me all the situations, bad or good, that they were going to face. Within two hours, I had air again. Everyone I dealt with was so nice and they really got the job taken care of fast! I will definitely be calling them and recommending them to all my friends!"

I was informed that a technician would be out same day and was provided  the assessment fee amount.\nThe technician arrived promptly (earlier than expected). He was nice, immediately discovered the problem (AC pipe clogged with gunk), thoroughly explained the problem and resolution. The pipe was disassembled, thoroughly cleaned, reassembled and tested. Technician also cleaned the floor area with wet-vac. The quality of service was excellent, fast and affordable."

We purchased our system from them and David and Brandon stayed until after 10:00 that night to finish the job to be sure we weren't left overnight without air.\n<br>Alatec service and product were both excellent and we'll continue to do our air and heading business with them and I highly recommend you consider them for your needs."

First off you\u2019re not saying nothing slick to a can of oil!! So I sent him on his way & called Alatec Heating & Cooling. Sean came & looked at the outside unit then went up to the attic. He told me his findings & said it would cost me $220. I said thank you for your honesty & he got right to work. He vacuumed water from a pan, found that the refrigerant was a pound low so he charged it, clean the drain pan, cleaned up oil around the suction port & checked all coils. He came back downstairs & turned everything back on. Now before he arrived that morning my home was a very hot 88 degrees. Later that afternoon/early evening it was a very comfortable 78 degrees which is what I normally keep it on when I\u2019m home. I highly recommend Alatec Heating & Cooling to everyone having heating & cooling issues. Thank you Jesus for sending the right company. Thank you Alatec for your service & having honest hard working people in your company that doesn\u2019t try to con people out of their hard earned money. I pray that God bless you so that your company expands to every state in the U.S.!! Keep treating your customers with respect & honesty & doing the job right at a reasonable & fair price & there will be no limit to your success!!!"

I bought my last central unit from them several years ago and I use their maintenance protection plan. I NEVER have to worry about having my \"check up\" twice a year AND if anything POPS  up in between, they are \"Johnny on the Spot\". It is a comforting feeling knowing there is still a company who cares about their clients."

They charged us $280 to replace a capacitor and for a service call charge. They then recommended we should get an all new HVAC system, which ours is old, but they suggested it would break the next day. We asked for a quote for a middle of the road system  - they quoted us originally $10,000 then knocked to down to $8,500 for a \"pre-season\" discount. We got a quote from another company that came in at $6,000 max. They also told us that \"capacitors don't just go out,\" which they do... capacitors have a lifespan just like any other part.  (They also conned my elderly neighbor into buying a really expensive new HVAC system... similar story.) Long story short, beware of this company unless you want to pay $$$!!"

All I can say is my first experience with them was FANTASTIC!!\nI had Alabama Air come to give me a quote on a system that I was told needed replacing.  I was told this by another heating and air company, where the technicians are on commission (although I was not aware that the technicians were on commission at the time)\nThe Alabama Air  technician came exactly on time, did an examination of the system in question and told me the system was in perfect working condition and did not need to be replaced.\nI truly appreciate their honesty and integrity.\nI have since signed up for their service contract (which by the way I had to inquire about)"

After taking possession of the property I learned that there were sewer issues with the building. Called a local company. After approximately 3 hours they had done absolutely nothing I asked him to leave and reached out to Brown. The service was great they responded within an hour, and came out the next day. Within 30 minutes they had found the blockage with their camera and ran a sewer machine in drain removing the clogged and clearing the line. Reset the toilet that the previous plumber left off. And gained another very happy customer if you were going to hire a plumber electrician or HVAC technician. this is who I would call and will be who I am calling from here on out."

        "text": "I recently came home to a burst water pipe that flooded our whole house late on Wednesday- After I got in touch with a water mitigation company who helped us out, I called Brown's & they got us a plumber out the next day (Thursday). I was told it was just for a diagnosis, and the following day would be likely be when the repairs could be done.\nMalakai came out on time the day after, and immediately set to work finding the burst pipe - he told us the material was old & the pipe wasn't even insulated- the culprit being the external faucet for the back yard. Then he said he could literally start repairing right then and there! Malakai not only got parts very quickly, replaced the pipe with correct modern material piping, he insulated the whole pipe as far as the attic & installed a new shut off valve so we could drain the pipe for future winters. I am not a very handy guy, but Malakai was so easy to communicate with, explaining each step and option very courteously. He is honestly a credit to Brown's - who I already liked because I have a service contract with them- but after his amazing service I wouldn't recommend anybody else to look after your plumbing, heating & cooling. Thank you, Malakai!"

Friendly people ( my normal tech, David is a fantastic guy) and fast service, I also appreciate that they seem to hire folks that are better quality than I've experienced with some competitors of theirs. I've had them change out several OLD units over the years and all the new ones have performed perfectly. As an old HVAC tech myself from many years ago I'm very picky about who does my work and I also know when someone is trying to sell me something I don't need, happy to report that they have passed on both accounts as they do good work and they don't try to sell me stuff I don't need or just throw parts at something until it's fixed. Highly recommend."

He gave us different options when it came to choosing the HVAC system we needed for our home. He gave us the pros and cons of each and did not try to hard sell us on a more expensive unit. On top of having the best quotes, price wise, he also went over the company's satisfaction guarantees, which none of the 3 other companies that gave us quotes could match. When it came to the install, it was done with respect for our home, the floors and furniture. They also did the entire replacement in one day. We highly recommend Brown Heating and Air, and Brandon."

I know I was a thorn in their sides, but I knew something was off and overlooked.  The last technician that came out to my home a few days ago was Brandon. He asked a few questions and asked if he could just start fresh, and I said yes. He was very knowledgeable, professional, courteous, and made sure he put booties over his boots and cleaned up after his work was done. It didn't take him long to diagnose the problem. He even showed me where the problem was located and what he did to rectify the issue. Brandon came back this morning and placed a newer thermostat in. He programmed the thermostat along with helping me set up the app on my phone. I can't say enough about him. He's a great asset to Brown's Heating and Cooling. He stands behind his work and his name.  He is so professional and seems to be a very honest and trustworthy person!  Brown's is grateful to have a highly skilled and professional team member. Thank you, Brandon, for all of your dedicated work!! You deserve 10 \ud83c\udf1f !!!! Paul"

Instead, he diagnosed a number of issues that I had never even considered - from cleaning my A/C unit, to ductwork repair, to maximizing airflow through the house. That kind of honesty and expertise in the service industry is as rare as it is appreciated. And he saved me some serious cash.

Matt Locklin at Dr. Cool was the answer. I called Matt on Friday morning. He answered despite being with his family. He offered to send his team out to install window AC\u2019s in upstairs bedrooms to get them through the weekend. They were out first thing Monday morning. Handled the warranty stuff for the coil, picked it up, and installed it.\n\nThe AC went out again yesterday. Matt sent his guy out and quickly diagnosed the problem. It was actually an oversight by another company who installed the furnace and transition to the coil.\n\nDr. Cool corrected the other companies work, ran a full diagnostic and now all is well.\n\nI\u2019ll call Matt and Dr. Cool again when we need AC service or repair!"

They tried to scare me about carbon monoxide fumes and the parts were in short supply so that I would commit and move faster. I called Dr. Cool (which I should have just done to begin with but had a service package with this company for prior septic work) and he kindly debunked everything they had told me. I'm a single mom with no heat during our coldest winter. The other company preyed on that. Dr. Cool is very knowledgable, responsive and most importantly ETHICAL!!\n\nOld Review: Great work. Quick, efficient and saved me about $500. I used Dr. Cool as a second opinion to an estimate given by a big brand. Dr. Cool said their fix wasn't necessary, I let him move forward with his work and haven't had a problem with AC, since. I also liked that he was concerned about my kids' safety when he was working on the AC and told them not to go near the unit and what was dangerous. Great experience all around. My go-to AC person if I need him again."

We had a  brand new 2.5 ton unit but the problem was that it was pumping AC through old furnace vents.  That was fine for our downstairs but terrible for the 2nd floor.\n\nLong story short, Matt quickly diagnosed the problem and was able to install a new 1 ton unit for our second floor.  He cut new vents for each room on our second floor, installed an air distributor in our attic, and even fixed our attic fan in 2 days!  It was amazing and we've been nice and cool for the past few summers!"

And of course it broke down after 6pm so that I'd need to pay after-hours rates for the dispatch fee. Of course.\nI called at least 10 businesses and several times each. Wade was the only one that 1) wasn't charging exorbitantly just to come out and 2) were available relatively soon.\nJustin from Wade came out and was amazing! He couldn't find anything awry, except that our breakers were off, so he did not charge us for any repair, even though he'd spent at least 30 minutes troubleshooting. As far as we are concerned, he could have come up with something for which to charge us, but he did not. He even advised us on A/C and filter maintenance.\nWe are extremely thankful for the swift and honest work that he did. He was professional, kind, timely, informative, and didn't try to pull one over on us. We will absolutely call Wade again in the future! You should too!"

He's that rare combination of friendly, honest, and extremely knowledgeable and he went out of his way to make sure we not only were pleased with everything, but also to make sure we made the right decisions; even if that meant us paying less.

They had someone to me by 11:48 and had my air on by 12:07. Zach the technician was incredibly professional. The office called to let me know he was on his way and when he had arrived so there were no surprises at the front door. Wade Heating and Air called me the next day to make sure everything was okay. I cannot say enough good things about this great company."

They were able to relocate where I change the monthly filter to inside the house, eliminating having to crawl into the crawl space to do it - a huge help!  Air & heat have worked wonderfully.  They have performed excellent work & service, I highly recommend."

After having my heater stop working on New Years day I called the warranty I had and was told it would be covered and I would have no charge. Then Wade Heating and Air called me and I asked three time if there would be any charge I was told no each time. Once he arrived I asked  the Tech Zach if there was any fees for him coming out I was reassured once again there would not be. Now after he was done looking at the furnace he told me his diagnostic and said he was going to do the paper work. Then he came back and asked me to sign an $85 dollar bill. After discussing he called his dad who told him to just get me to sign it and they would turn me over to collections. I would not use or recommend this company to anyone. I have now received a bill and been called a liar on the phone by Bill Zach's Dad who told me his son told him everything, so I should just go to a different company and pay my bill."

        "text": "I suspected there was a leak in our water main between the house and the meter.  I heard water running through a pipe at the front of the house when all water was turned off in the house and the irrigation line was shut off.  Nate from OnTime showed up; and, we discussed the situation.  He went over the pricing if the fix were to a galvanized line leak or if the fix were to a copper line leak.  I had visions of my front shrub bed and lawn being torn up to find and fix the problem.  Nate allowed me to rake mulch away from the suspect site and to put a tarp out for him to put the dirt on that he dug out to find the leak.  He was very careful to do minimal damage to the shrubs as he dug the hole.  He found the leak very quickly about three feet down and quickly made the repair.  He had to angle his digging down to reach the leak in order to keep from removing shrubs that would have been obvious from the street.  When he finished filling back the hole, he raked the mulch back and you would have to look hard to even guess there was work done in the area.  My experience with plumbers in the past was just the opposite where they viewed their job as fix the problem, not to return it to great condition.  Nate cared about both fixing the problem and cleaning up the site with minimal invasion.  Thank you Nate!  Thank you OnTime for sending Nate!  Great job for a fair price!"

First was for a frozen AC and the technician actually worked directly with our warranty to get the whole service covered which was beyond helpful. Second time was for a \u201cwater hammer\u201d, our technician was fantastic and got it fixed within an hour or so. Third was a hot water heater not working. Ron came out within two hours and showed me how to light the pilot light to my hot water heater. He gave me a lot of info about the water heater as well, we talked about replacing and costs for that and how important it was to prepare for that rather than waiting until it was busted. I appreciated the education along with the service. Now I can light it myself instead of paying $40 every time the wind blows too hard.\nI tell everyone I know about on time when they have their own home issues. We need more companies that have such high standards and customer service. Yall rock!!"

A neighbor highly recommended getting a quote from AGA HVAC  Services as they replaced the same systems for her the previous year.\n\nAGA provided a detailed quote, very competitive pricing, and was happy to answer ALL of our questions. Thankfully, they were able to coordinate the install of both systems to take place on the same day. The entire team was professional, friendly, and did a great job.  Following the install, they were very helpful (and patient) in providing an A-Z overview of the new Nest smart thermostat. They also completed the online owner\u2019s registration for the HVAC system which extended our warranty another 5 years.\n\nPrior to leaving, the owner provided his cell number with instructions to call if we had any follow-up questions regarding the new smart thermostat rather than referring us to the owner\u2019s manual. A week following the installation, the owner followed up to see if we had any questions or issues. This level of customer support is MUCH appreciated!\n\nI would definitely recommend AGA HVAC Services to others, and we will call on them again for any future HVAC and/or plumbing needs."

I was charged $125, offered no solution to the problem. I told them it wasn\u2019t working, I didn\u2019t need to pay someone $125 to confirm that it wasn\u2019t working. I wanted someone who could fix the problem or at best offer a solution with a price. I\u2019m beyond disappointed.\n\nUPDATE- I spoke with someone today. The unit is still under warranty, but they don\u2019t make it anymore, so they are still trying to locate the missing part. If they can\u2019t find it, they will have to replace the unit. I still think the time frame for a solution is a little extreme. Luckily it\u2019s not mid summer and the room isn\u2019t being used right now."

Fast forward, I\u2019ve had issues with both upstairs and downstairs units. The last guys I hired to come out, they found the issue and that issue goes all the way back to the original install. Parker and Sons used plumbing solder instead of the correct solder. They cut corners and use cheaper materials. I can\u2019t help but think that had they done the job right, my units would have lasted longer."

The dude is professional, friendly, sharp, and LOCKED ON to fixing your AC.  No hard sell to buy a whole new system as some \"other companies\" are keen to do. This last time, Bart took apart the \"other company's\" (let's just say one of the major players) previous work and found that they hadn't even installed a required part...they just left it out completely and \"called it good.\"  Well, when the \"other company\" did that work I called them right back and told them it wasn't cooling as well as I knew it should and they totally blew me off.  They knew damn well they had left that piston out and still lied to me, claiming it was the \"other unit\" that wasn't cooling.  Well, I won't be calling that \"other company\" EVER again...Thanks to Parker & Sons my upstairs system pulled down to 70 last night with no problem for the first time in quite some years....I'll stick with Parker from now on and ask for Bart by name..."

It is now a month later my AC went out again. I put a claim in and they did a recall so he could come back out again to fix the issue. It was dispatched to him early Thursday morning but I didn\u2019t hear from him until Friday morning at 8. He said he would be back out to fix it and would call me around 10. I never received a phone call. I called him but no answer and I left a voicemail. I tried calling 30 minutes later. Phone ring immediately was sent to voicemail. I then text him and told him that it is 90 degrees outside so it\u2019s even hotter inside the house. I had just brought my mom home from being in the hospital for 20 days due to finding out she has cancer so the last thing I need her to be uncomfortable in this way. I saying all this to say that a company should never conduct business this way by not acknowledging a conversation. This company needs to be banned from all warranty companies because this is unacceptable. So please who ever that is about to use this guy, DON\u2019T!!!!! Poor way of conducting business."

They are hard to communicate with, don\u2019t answer calls, sometimes will text, and arrive hours late for the appointment time if they arrive at all. They promise to call back but never do and you will spend hours trying to contact them. They left us without AC for two weeks and then put a hard start kit in to try to get the unit going until a compressor came in. Two weeks of 90 plus temps in my house when it could have been done on the first day. My compressor was never installed (second week of July now) so I had to pay another service fee to have another company fix my AC which by the way was NOT the compressor. I now have working AC after 20 minutes of another company fixing my AC that had been down since May."

Air conditioner stopped working, they missed the Friday appointment with no communication. Came in Saturday. Did not have a condenser to fix my air conditioner. Ordered the part Monday. It is Monday night, 4 days later with no air conditioner. A&E does not go the extra mile to help."

I have a family including two kids under 3 and am at my absolute wits' end. I've had to spend the holidays at my mother's house, mother-in-law's and anywhere else we can find a bed because these buffoons can't do their job. It's obvious that they don't want to do their job and have no desire to help customers. They've played the blame game, not shown up to at least FOUR appointments after they've called me saying they were on their way and haven't communicated ANYTHING to me after multiple issues with this claim. They've also sent 4 different people out each time I've needed assistance who have all given 4 explanations as to what our \"problem\" is. You'd think that a business would at least have the wherewithal and internal communication skills to talk about an issue so they can problem solve it, right? THINK AGAIN! There is no logic. There is no rhyme or reason and there certainly is NO customer service. Look somewhere else."

Received a quote for exhaust and venting installation that first started out at $2,250 !! for three bathrooms. After one sentence voicing skepticism at that quote, the rep that was at my house to provide estimate went back to his truck, called someone in the office, came back inside, and the quote suddenly dropped to $1,650. After voicing further skepticism, I asked what the cost would be for just install if I bought exhaust fans myself. Quote dropped almost $900 again, implying a massive mark up for exhaust fans.\nUltimately, I wound up not using this company as I could not get an honest answer as to what work was being performed and at what cost. Buyer beware!"

From start to finish, Patrick's professionalism and expertise were truly outstanding.\n\nPatrick took the time to thoroughly explain my system to me, identifying the root cause of the issue and explaining the necessary steps to rectify it. His clear and concise explanations helped me understand the problem better and made me feel confident in his abilities.\n\nNot only was Patrick knowledgeable, but he also displayed a remarkable level of care and attention to detail throughout the repair process. He ensured that every aspect of the job was completed to the highest standard, leaving no stone unturned in his quest to restore my system to its optimal condition.\n\nFurthermore, Patrick's friendly demeanor and approachable nature made the entire experience pleasant and stress-free. He went above and beyond to answer all of my questions and address any concerns I had, making me feel valued as a customer.\n\nThanks to Patrick's expertise and dedication, my air conditioning system is now running smoothly again, providing much-needed relief during these hot summer days. I cannot recommend Polar Bear Services and Patrick highly enough for their exceptional service and professionalism. If you're in need of air conditioning repairs, look no further than Polar Bear Services and request Patrick\u2014you won't be disappointed.\n\nSide-note\u2026I reached out to them at 5:20pm and the owner called me within 5 minutes.

Face it, if we had the genuine skills to do the job ourselves, we'd already be up on the roof. Instead, we look for the people who do have the critical experience, we lend our trust to them, and we hope for the best. Sadly, we often find out too late that they lacked the knowledge, or even worse, they abused our trust.\n\nWe've been using Polar Bear exclusively for the past seven years at a somewhat older facility that's absolutely chock-full of \"character\", and never once have they steered us wrong. They've no doubt saved us tons just by preventing us from spending when we gladly would have.\n\nEver had the feeling that a heating & air vendor was just trying to sell you a load of expensive new equipment when the right investment would instead have been to fix what you had? Or, that maybe they were steering you towards a rushed decision when maybe thinking it through for a bit would have led to a much smarter and more economical outcome?\n\nYou'll never have those nagging feelings with the team at Polar Bear. William is a straight-shooter, and has said many times that he's not interested in just taking today's business, he wants to be a partner you can trust for the long-term. I can tell you sincerely, I have never once regretted taking his suggestions.\n\nChoose them as your partners today- You'll be glad that you did.\n\n(Too bad there's only five stars)"

I spoke with William (owner) late Friday evening and he took the time to explain what options there were for repair including the pros and cons of each option (was not in a rush or pushy). He not only gave me a quote over the phone, but had an appointment for me the following Monday at 8am. He had the part I needed in stock, and Christian arrived promptly at my home at 8am. Christian was very professional, courteous, and efficient. He went above and beyond what was required for the repair by sealing our ductwork near the unit to ensure efficiency of the system. If you have contemplated who to use when you have a need for HVAC repair, installation, or maintenance, look no further than Polar Bear Services! They are on speed dial in my phone and have earned my business in the future. Thank you again for taking care of us!"

Polar Bear  didn't come out and do any quick fixes, they got down to the bottom of what was causing the issues and repaired it! The staff at Polar Bear are very courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. Their excellent customer service is on point!

And will use Polar Bear again.\n\nHad this company come out and do a routine check to ensure our A/C unit was in good repair, I was quoted $89 for 1 system. Paid $130, they did not do anything extra. On top of witch he did not change out the filter which was bad, and we had no idea there was a filter in this spot to change. (Recently purchased home)\n7 days later the A/C is not cooling properly. On the 8th day it stopped completely. Another guy was sent out, and we\u2019re told there was a wire that burnt out causing the motor to burn out. So, now they want  $1200 to replace motor. Spoke with the technician and called to speak with supervisor. Who states, that this could not have been predicted. So what is the point of preventative maintenance??\nWe went with another company to replace motor.\nThe sad thing is, I have medical issues and I am very sensitive to heat. Over exposure can cause me to have seizures. So I\u2019ll be camping in my motor home with A/C til it\u2019s repaired. But if I didn\u2019t have that option?? Motel? It\u2019s a racket."

We shut the unit down and have been riding it out for a few weeks without heat or air not wanting to spend a lot of money going into 'Winter 2020' during a pandemic.  Now it is getting down into the 30's, so we made the calls...  The moment I contacted Polar Bear Services, Billy Weller, the owner responded.  I told him what was going on, what we needed and wanted from the type of unit to warranties. Mr Weller gave us a quote and offered several payment options.  We had other quotes to compare this to and Polar Bear was by far the most affordable for the exact same system. We chose Polar Bear and Mr Weller had his crew here the following morning to replace the entire system.  The technicians were on time, very polite, professional, know what they're doing AND they replaced the old single-wall pipes to double-wall getting us up to Code too.  I strongly recommend Billy Weller & Polar Bear Services... I give Polar Bear an A+!"

They said everything was fine. A week later, the temperature in the house starts rising so we call them out to look at it again. First, they told us they\u2019d be out in a few hours since no one was home at the time. They call my fianc\u00e9 back a couple minutes later and say they are at the house waiting on us and he proceeds to tell the guy he told someone on the phone no one was there for at least another hour. The service guy got angry with us because of poor communication within the company. Then, the service guy proceeds to tell me it\u2019s because the unit \u201cmight\u201d be low on Freon. He never looked at the system in the basement, just outside so I don\u2019t know how he got an accurate solution.  He charged us for the most expensive Freon (he only used 1 lb) and $99 for less than an hour of service. Needless to say, it was a complete waste of time and money because the problem was ongoing and we had another company come out a few days later. That company was able to tell us the problem right away which the other guy would have, maybe, known had he looked at the system in the basement. Needless to say, the Polar Bear services guy didn\u2019t seem to know what he was doing but had no problem charging an unnecessary, large amount of money. We will not be using this company again."

        "text": "$3850 + $79.99 wasted!!!!! Our AC stopped working and we were advised we need a coil and condensor replaced. The fee for that was $3850. A month later the ac went back to blowing hot air. We called for PB to come back out and the technician stated a part was loose and needed to be replaced from the first service job and we would not be charged. That fixed it for about another month or two. The next technician stated a frog short circuited the system and he removed it and the ac went back to blowing like it should for another couple weeks. Every visit after the alleged frog incident has been one excuse after the other. We're doing renovations and were told the filters needed to be changed more frequently and the house would cool down. We continued to change them weekly and still no luck. We called yet again to advise of the continuing problem only to be charged $79.99 for them to clean the coils and blame the filters. The AC still continued to blow hot air and then the attic began to leak. So ANOTHER call was made. The technician stated the coils were frozen and that the ac needed to be turned off and to change the filter again (at this point we're already changing it weekly and have completed the renovations). The house still didnt cool down and the ac was still leaking. Another call was made the same day (as a leaking attic is urgent and ruining the ceiling) the technician returned and said the coil was shooting out water (ya think!!!! That's why we called in the first place!) had they bothered to look and not blame it on the filter they would have discovered it on the first visit. So the technician fixes the leak and says give it time, the house will cool. Guess what, it's still not cooling!!! So we wait a week (we work and can't keep taking off for someone to come out) and call them back out. The technician now states the roof doesnt have enough vents  and the attic door is off centered and that is what's causing the house not to cool. He said he tweaked something and give it a minute and it will cool. He also states he was advised to charge for coming out. What is there to charge for? The house is still hot, the temperature is steady rising as I type, and the original problem has not been fixed. They're basically grasping  at straws at this point and have run out of probable excuses.  Be prepared to throw away $4000 plus dollars and live in heat if you use this company. Currently in search of another AC company."

Now that the unit is getting older I'm trying to milk every year I can out of it. The house was not cooling so I called them and they came out today ...unit is in good shape. They cleaned the coils and checked everything out. Come to find out one of the branch ducts had come aloose and cool air was going under the house ....this was fixed and it's getting cooler now as I type. We keep the house cold like 65 degrees during the hot summer months. We work outside and it's always nice to come home to a cool house. Thanks to the tech that came out he was awesome."

They told me I did not need a new system, and made a repair that cost maybe $100 instead of the thousands I would have spent otherwise. This time, one of their techs, Noah, was able to solve a strange problem I was having with my thermostat not reading correctly even though it was functioning fine, and the system was functioning fine\u2014something no one else has been able to solve. (Let's just say it was actually an insulation issue, not an HVAC issue. But he still fixed it.) I'm thankful for their trustworthiness because that can be hard to find.

        "text": "Our 14 year old Trane AC died a week ago. After getting a quote from a well known 5\u2b50\ufe0f company in Birmingham, I had sticker shock at the replacement cost for a unit that was not near the quality of a Trane and a downgrade compared to my current specs. A friend recommended Chris Kelley at Absolute Air. What a lifesaver. He arrived within two hours after my call. He quoted me an American Standard (maker of Trane) that significantly upgraded my current seer rating and added a variable speed versus single stage unit. His price cremated the previous company\u2019s quote with a superior product and upgrade. Unit was installed less than 48 hours later. Excellent service techs that were polite and so helpful. I don\u2019t think I have ever been so impressed with an HVAC company. Thank you Chris."

But he's not reliable.\n\nHe had already been to my house on a couple of calls over the last couple of years, and did a great job. Back in October, I left him a voice mail on his cell phone to check my HVAC unit. No reply.\n\nA few days later I texted him, and got a return text he would get back to me later. I never heard from him.\n\nHis voice mail says call his office for immediate help. I then left a message with a woman who answered the phone, who i assume was his secretary. She said she would pass the message on to him and he would call to set up an appointment. I never heard from him. In my book, three strikes and you're out.\n\nI have no idea why he didn't want the business. But even if I had been a new customer, if he didn't want the business, or was too busy and didn't have time, you would think he would have the professional courtesy to call and say he was too busy. Or call back and say something.\n\nI called Norrell, who was recommended by some friends. They responded immediately and fixed the problem at a reasonable rate. I won't be calling Absolute Air again."

I was able to set up the appointment via text (within 24 hours of my text!) and got a call the morning of to let me know they were on the way. Both units at our house are older, but rather than trying to sell me something I don't need today, Ron, the technician, was able to keep things up and running and it didn't break the bank. He helped educate me on different parts of the unit and what to do when it is time to finally get a whole new unit (and hopefully how to avoid needing two at the same time!) At no time did I feel like he was trying to sell me on anything I didn't need. He was professional and courteous. We will definitely be calling them for our annual service as well as for anything that comes up in between!"

NO ONE that I had used in the past would come to my house and check my AC unit in the attic. Cool Temp did! They totally discovered the problem and reported fully to my Home Warranty Company.  Charles was very professional, obviously knowledgeable and I wish I had the choice of never choosing anyone else. Incredible service from an incredible Company!"

Repair was further delayed by our insurance approval process.  After our approval, Charles picked up the required parts late in the day and sent two technicians out the next morning, Holiday July 4th!!  Repairs were completed promptly, and we had air conditioning.  We definitely recommend Cool Temp Air!!  Thanks!!"

At first, I thought it was a minor issue, but it turned out the motor had burned out due to electrical fuse wear. Leo's inspection and repair were very professional. He also did an evaluation and monitoring for me, telling me which parts could hold up for now and what to keep an eye on. I've had too many repairmen try to convince me to replace things that don't really need replacing, but Leo was very honest and gave advice from my perspective. The final cost was also very reasonable."

Jonah and Billy came out today to put me in a new overhead riser and meter box and breaker box on the outside of my house after the big storms on March 5th. tree on my property came down on the electric lines going into my home and messed everything up. the boys came out over an hour earlier than they were scheduled to and got every bit of the work done in 5 hours. unfortunately due to no problems on Dunn's part I've got to wait two more days with no electricity. just got to love code inspectors that won't come out to do their job when they're called."

Several mistakes were made but they came back and made it right. Not impressed with Rickey. He never wore shoe protectors inside or asked if I'd like for him to. He walked on my cream carpet in very dirty shoes in my bedroom. They drilled through a water line and cut a baseboard unnecessarily because they attempted to install the wrong floor vent ( it wasn't even a floor vent). I questioned Rickey about it being so flimsy and he told me it was supposed to be that way. But it wasn't. They also made a miscut on the floor that has to be patched.  So while I'd give the company an A rating, if give the installers a D. Just too many mistakes.  Also they left the job without installing my filters."

Dunn\u2019s was the only response, and they sent Gene to the house to assess the problem.  Gene arrived promptly and quickly determined the float and/or its switch was stuck and, after recycling everything, got it working again. I was charged only a very reasonable service charge.  I very much appreciated that Gene (and Dunn\u2019s) did not invent unnecessary repairs to pad the bill.  For this honesty and efficient work, they are now my go-to plumbing company for any future problems."

Never been lied too, never been steered in wrong direction.

These guys have gone above and beyond to make sure everything was right. I haven't had anything better than Dunn's, haven't needed to find out.\n\nThe job isn't done until it's Dunn.\n\nThank you, truly!"

Cheyenne called me later with a date and time 1-14-24 between 10-12:00 a.m.\n\nOn 1-14-25 Lee H from Dunn\u2019s HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical came to my home at 10:10 a.m. to assess my hot water heater.  He was efficient, polite, respectful, and professional with his evaluation and assessment of my hot water heater to process my claim.\n\nOn 1-17-25 I called Dunn\u2019s and spoke with Cheyenne to set up a removal date of 1-20-25.\n\nOn 1-20-25 Hunter and Aubrey came to my home to remove my defective hot water heater.  They drained the excess water from the hot water heater and then removed it from my home.  Both were efficient, polite, and respectful.\n\nOn 1-28-25 I spoke with Alisha to schedule a date and time for my new hot water heater to be installed.  It was scheduled for 2-4-25.\n\nOn 2-3-25 I had to call Dunn\u2019s to reschedule due to a date change of my carpet installation.  I spoke with Cheyenne about my issue.  She was very cordial and understanding about the schedule change.  She was very polite and easily assisted me with the new date and time - 2-7-25 between 8:00 - 12:00 a.m. for my new hot water heater installation.\n\nOn 2-7-25 at 9:45 a.m. Dalton and Will came to install my new hot water heater - a  Bradford White model.  They made sure everything was working properly before leaving.  In addition, they corrected a beeping smoke detector and reattached my dryer vent hose in the crawlspace underneath my home.  They were very courteous, efficient, polite, and professional!  They made sure to clean up behind themselves which I greatly appreciated!\n\nDunn\u2019s HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical will be my one-stop shop for any future home needs!  I trust Dunn\u2019s to meet my home needs!  Their office staff and technicians eased my concerns throughout this long process. Thanks for restoring home\u2019s hot water heater!!"

She was so friendly and polite and I could tell she was dedicated to get my problem taken care of.  The scheduling was immediate and I got an email confirmation, plus a text from the plumber himself.  I then received the plumbers picture and bio, with his credentials.  Then he called to get more specifics to be sure he had the right parts for the job.  There were two guys on my call which sped up the work.  It was in a 2ft high crawl space so they took photos and gave me a complete scope of work.  Plumbers are never cheap but with where they had to crawl and what they had to do, it was well worth it. Not sure about other plumbers at Dunn\u2019s but the ones I had were OUTSTANDING!  I highly recommend.\nI have had Dunns out for a second problem and again I sing their praise.  This time we had a plumber named Aubrey.  He was great. We are under contract so no service charge involved but he evaluated our problem and we asked for a detailed complete quote to deal with our plumbing issues.  We had the quote within 4 hours of his visit and it is reasonable in price. I will call Dunns for any and every issue and I will know it\u2019s a responsible company."

They managed to get two techs out there within an hour and they stayed until the job was complete - around 9 PM! Their Can-Do attitude and professional workmanship were exceptional and a blessing to our family - because of their dedication, two elderly people didn't have to deal with the freeze without water and we didn't have to drive in from Northeast Atlanta to rescue them! A heart-felt \"Thank You\" to the company and the two patient young men who took care of the work. I highly recommend this business."

        "text": "Our experience with Plus One Heating and Air began almost two years ago when our church needed two new 15-ton A/C units which were located in a third floor mechanical room that allowed no access for removing the old units and installing new ones without cutting a hole in either the roof or an exterior wall. Neither of those two options were preferred, so we contacted Plus One and asked if they could remove the existing units by disassembling them and installing new coils, motors, refrigerant piping, etc. in the old units' cabinets. As it turned out, earlier that year they had completed the same procedure on another job and felt very confident they could do the same for us.\nWe awarded them the contract and they immediately began taking exacting measurements of the existing units, which were sent to the manufacturers of our new units. It took only six weeks to have the old units completely disassembled, carried down three flights of stairs hauled away, have the old 15-ton condensing units removed, receive the new coils, condensing units, all of the piping reconfigured and soldered-in, and the units up and running in just under six weeks. We had not had to knock out any walls or roof structure, saving our church tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSince that installation we have had Plus One replace three more obsolete and non-working A/C units with almost flawless efficiency and at lower cost than any of the previous installations at our church.\n\nDaniel has lead their teams of technicians on all of our jobs and every one of them are friendly, courteous and always helpful to me in my position as the church's Properties Committee Chairman.\n\nWhoever you are and whatever A/C or Heating needs you have, I recommend you first call Plus One and give them the job. You wont regret it.\n\nEastside Baptist Church\nSteve M. Thornton, Properties Committee"

        "text": "Edit: 1.5 yrs after paying $12k for a brand new heater and AC unit, I had an independent and highly rated company come do an annual checkup on the system. They found that the tape/mastic sealing the blower to the vents had detached and come up. (See pics.) They noted this was normal to see over time but abnormal for a system this young. I called TemperaturePro thinking this would be an easy fix. It's just tape. Didn't expect them to work for free but hoped they would work with me to make it right. I calmly explained the situation to Brooklyn, but she got oddly defensive, noting the labor warranty was now up and even at one point suggesting the new company could have pulled up the tape themselves. This was a huge turn-off. I expected they'd send someone out for an easy tape repair and stand behind their work. Instead, they tried to shift blame and make excuses. Then Brooklyn said she'd confer with the team and get back to me about a price for repairs. They never did. Very disappointing customer service for such a minor job after such a big expense. If they get this defensive and noncooperative over tape, I worry what else will go wrong with the system down the road.\n\nOriginal Post: AC went out close to the weekend. Shawn responded before anyone and got a team to volunteer for Saturday work in 95 degree heat. Jaylon and Daniel were great. All standup dudes!"

He was adamant from the first visit that that was not the issue and that he had a set of items in order that we could start knocking out in a stairstep fashion to see improvement in our cooling issues that we were experiencing.    He also brought out the owner Sean a couple of times to make sure the prescription to the issues we were having cooling our upstairs was prioritized and addressed accordingly.  I have never had anyone in the service industry spend as much time needed to figure it out and to figure it our the right way.  I had lots of questions and challenged conventional thinking about what was needed and how it will all improve my situation and Daniel was patient through and was willing to explain/show how his approach would work.  After the first two items were completed we weren't seeing the numbers we wanted so they came back out to check over everything.  Made some adjustments and BOOM like a light switch the numbers fell in line.  All I can say is that my experience with Daniel, Sean and the TemperaturePro team was beyond excellent.  I will never have another company work on my units.  PERIOD!!! #customerforlife.  Thanks Daniel and Sean.  You all will crush your competitors with your honest and professional approach....keep it up."

Both were over 25 years old. Even though they could not install the second unit for a few days, they placed a portable ac unit in our daughters room so she could sleep there. Daniel communicated extremely well and delivered what he promised. They are not the cheapest company in town, but I've learned you get what you pay for. For us it was well worth the investment and I would recommend them. We plan on utilizing their service as well. They are professional, prompt, concerned for the customer and did a fantastic job on both installs upgrading our ductwork and putting in safety features that will provide a peace of mind for years to come."

They came out and said I needed a $5000 repair. I called temperature pro to get a second opinion. Daniel came out and assessed the system, agreed we needed some work done but the price was less than half of what I was quoted from the other company! And for a much better (and permanent)  repair solution too!! Daniel was honest about our issues, answered all of my questions and took the time to make sure I completely understood what was going on with our system. Over the years we\u2019ve had a few different companies do maintenance and such on our system, but Daniel was the first person to mention a few different (very important) issues we have going on. He didn\u2019t try to sell me anything, rather just educated and informed me. We in turn are using their company for the repairs and have signed up for their yearly maintenance. I appreciated Daniel\u2019s professionalism, character, and personality very much!!! I felt totally comfortable and didn\u2019t feel like they were trying to take advantage of me at all.

She was so compassionate and took the extra step to personally reach out to the leasing company to confirm that they were the correct vendor, and when the quote was submitted for the work. She has kept in contact with me this entire time. I am so thankful that she is the one I dealt with she is a wonderful representative for the company.\n\nWhen Mark M. got to the property he was met by my son, Justin. Mark took the time to explain the way the system worked (this is the 1st time we have had a gas furnace). I was so impressed by the knowledge that he has and his willingness to share and explain things to Justin. Justin said he was so nice, professional, and went ABOVE and BEYOND when checking the unit. Mark swapped out the filter and performed a VERY detailed inspection of the furnace and was able to determine the problem. He submitted the quote to the leasing company quickly and we are just waiting on a response.\n\nAt the end of the last call I had with Brooklyn I explained to her that this is a huge issue for us and that it was upsetting as a Mom that my son was there with NO heat (regardless of his age he's still my son) and how it still bothered me. She was so kind and told me if we ever had any questions about the furnace to call them and they would be glad to explain things to us.\n\nThis has been a rough issue with the leasing company but the good thing that they could have ever done for us was sending TemperaturePo to our rescue.\n\nGreat company & staff!!\nKristy Gentry"

They didn\u2019t try to stick us with a system we didn\u2019t need, in fact, the system they replaced our old one with was a smaller system because we didn\u2019t need one as big as we had. I love that you also get a text when your tech is on the way as well as a picture and brief bio of who is going to be at your home. We will continue to use them and recommend them to others!"

Less than 12 hours elapsed between when I initially called them, set up an appointment for the following morning, received a punctual, professional inspection and had my AC coil leak fixed and the freon refilled. Throughout this process, they used multiple technologies to keep me informed, with text alerts during scheduling, GPS tracking of the service member beforehand, digital analysis systems to read HVAC vital metrics, emails of all photos taken during inspection, instant and accurate PDF invoices with full breakdowns of costs. Steve Hess was friendly, knowledgeable, punctual and professional and helped me understand my repair options so I could feel confident about my repair decision. I couldn't have asked for better service and will absolutely be recommending TemperaturePro to family and friends."

Of the 3 companies that came out, it was very easy to make our decision and go with First Choice. Sonny (the owner) seems like a great guy who genuinely cares about both his customers & his employees, and wants to run an honest business. He even lent us an air cooler to help keep our house cool while they were working on it. They were able to replace our AC system & furnace quickly & at a fair price, and offered 0% financing options. They also furnished us with an 10 year parts & labor warranty on our new system!

Veteran owned and local family man, he's a great guy, very considerate and respectful.\n\nI called 3 places for service when our air went out on Saturday before Memorial Day, and each place wanted $225-$300 for an \"emergency\" holiday call, just to show up, not including parts, labor or fixing the problem.\n\nMcCoy showed up within 20 minutes of calling him and had our air fixed 10 minutes later. Total cost from Calvary Climate was less than just the service fee for showing up the other companies wanted.\n\nI'm getting him back out next week to clean and inspect the rest of my system before summer hits. Only a $69 fee you can't beat!\n\nIf you are having issues, do your family a favor and call, you can thank me later. Even if you aren't having issues now, the $69 fee is well worth the money to have him clean the coils, check all the capacitors, other system parts and the drainage. He won't lie or try to sell you anything you don't need, but he may find something that might become an issue and leave you without AC. Better to stay ahead of possible issues and replace things on your time frame rather than wake up hot and have no choice."

I\u2019ll definetly be using and reccomending Calvary Climate to my friends and family."

With summer rolling around, it has been hard to put off the issue any longer. Luckily Cavalry Climate saved the day with not only reasonable pricing, but within a very timely manner. The technician arrived within 45 minutes of my call, and not only fixed the problem, but exercised clear communication and made me feel confident in his work. Turns out my dryer duct was clogged as well, so I don\u2019t have to replace my dryer! 10/10 would recommend. Keep up the amazing work!"

When the technician arrived he told us he could not work on our AC because we live in a mobile home. He suggested another company, whom we called and set an appointment with for Thursday and they never showed. We were quite upset as the AC had been out since Monday, my husband found Calvary online and he called us back within about 5 minutes and was on his way here. He was here within the hour(mostly due to the travel time to us) and the AC was up and running within 30 minutes. Could not be happier with the service, price or knowledge! We will def be using this company for our future needs!"

Our old heat pump had broken down, and wasn't repairable, so Mr. Webb was able to get a new high quality heat pump unit at a very reasonable price, and got it installed smoothly and quickly.\n\nBefore I decided to make a purchase, Mr. Webb went over all of my options, and explained things to me in a way that someone who isn't a HVAC expert would understand.\n\nHe pointed out that the current refrigerant standard of R410A was being phased out at the end of this year, and was able to get me one based on the new standard (R32).\n\nIt's great to see that there are companies out there, especially small businesses, that are owned by honest folks who truly care about their customers.  I will definitely be using Mr. Webb's company for the forseeable future."
